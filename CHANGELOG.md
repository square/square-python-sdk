This `Payment`-level field provides device information for all types of payments. Previously, device details were only available for card payments (`Payment.card_details.device_details`), which is now deprecated.
    * Added the [team_member_id](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-10-20/objects/Payment#definition__property-team_member_id) that applications can use to view the ID of the [TeamMember](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-10-20/objects/TeamMember) associated with the payment. Use this field instead of the `Payment.employee_id` field, which is now deprecated.

    * The [ACH Bank Transfer Payments](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments/ach-payments) feature has moved to the GA state. Accordingly, the [bank_account_details](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-10-20/objects/Payment#definition__property-bank_account_details) field (and its [BankAccountPaymentDetails](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-10-20/objects/BankAccountPaymentDetails) type) are moved to the GA state. 
  * [CreatePayment](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-10-20/payments-api/create-payment) endpoint.

## API updates

* **Orders  API:** 
  * [OrderServiceCharge](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/objects/OrderServiceCharge) object. Added a new field, `type`. It identifies the service charge type.

  * [OrderQuantityUnit](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/objects/OrderQuantityUnit), 
    [OrderLineItem](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/objects/OrderLineItem), 
    [OrderLineItemDiscount](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/objects/OrderLineItemDiscount), 
    [OrderLineItemModifier](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/objects/OrderLineItemModifier), 
    [OrderLineItemTax](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/objects/OrderLineItemTax), 
    [OrderServiceCharge](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/objects/OrderServiceCharge), 
    [OrderReturnLineItem](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/objects/OrderReturnLineItem), 
    [OrderReturnLineItemModifier](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/objects/OrderReturnLineItemModifier),

* **Locations API:**
  * [Location](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/objects/Location) object. Added a new field `tax_ids` of type `TaxIds`. In the current implementation, sellers in Ireland and France can configure tax IDs during the onboarding process. They can also provide the information later by updating the location information in the Seller Dashboard. These tax IDs appear in this field.

* **Loyalty API:**
  * As of July 15, 2021, the country in which the seller’s Square account is activated determines whether Square uses pretax or post-tax purchase amounts to calculate accrued points. This change supports consumption tax models, such as value-added tax (VAT). Previously, point accrual was based on pretax purchase amounts only. This change does not affect the existing point balance of loyalty accounts.

You specify these values at the time  of creating a plan. After the plan is created, these fields cannot be updated. This makes a subscription plan immutable. 

* **Inventory API:**
  * [RetrieveInventoryTransfer.](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/inventory-api/Retrieve-Inventory-Transfer) This new endpoint is introduced to support the retrieval of inventory transfer.
  * [RetrieveInventoryChanges.](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/inventory-api/Retrieve-Inventory-Changes) This endpoint is deprecated. Its support ends when it is retired in about 12 months.  
  * The following endpoints have updated URLs to conform to the standard REST API convention. For more information about migrating deprecated URLs to updated URLs in your application, see [Inventory API: Migrate to Updated API Entities.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/inventory-api/migrate-to-updated-api-entities)
    * [RetrieveInventoryAdjustment](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/inventory-api/Retrieve-Inventory-Adjustment)
    * [BatchChangeInventory](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/inventory-api/Batch-Change-Inventory)
    * [BatchRetrieveInventoryChanges](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/inventory-api/Batch-Retrieve-Inventory-Changes) 
    * [BatchRetrieveInventoryCounts](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/inventory-api/Batch-Retrieve-Inventory-Counts)
    * [RetrieveInventoryPhysicalCount](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-07-21/inventory-api/Retrieve-Inventory-Physical-Count)

## Documentation updates
* **Webhooks.** Revised the steps and descriptions for creating and using webhooks. For more information, see [Webhooks Overview.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/webhooks/overview)


## Version 12.0.0.20210616 (2021-06-16)

* **Gift Cards API and Gift Card Activities API.** Gift card support is integrated in the [Square Seller Dashboard](https://squareup.com/dashboard/) and the [Square Point of Sale](https://squareup.com/us/en/point-of-sale)  application. Sellers can sell, redeem, track, and reload Square gift cards. Now developers can use the [Gift Cards API](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-06-16/gift-cards-api) and the [Gift Card Activities API](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-06-16/gift-card-activities-api) to integrate Square gift cards into third-party applications.

## SDKs

* **All Square SDKs:**

    By default, all SDKs send requests to Square's production (https://connect.squareup.com) or sandbox (https://connect.squareupsandbox.com) hosts based on the client's `environment` parameter.

    You now have the option to use a custom URL instead. To use a custom URL, follow the example for your language to set the `environment` parameter to `custom` and the `customUrl` parameter to your URL:

    - Java

      ```java
      new SquareClient.Builder()
        .environment(Environment.CUSTOM)
        .customUrl("https://example.com")
      ```

    - .NET

      ```csharp
      new Square.SquareClient.Builder()
        .Environment(Environment.Custom)
        .CustomUrl("https://example.com")
      ```

    - Node.js

      ```javascript
      new Client({
        environment: Environment.Custom,
        customUrl: 'https://example.com'
      });
      ```

    - PHP

      ```php
      new Square\SquareClient([
        'environment' => Environment::CUSTOM,
        'customUrl' => 'https://example.com',
      ]);
      ```

    - Python

      ```python
      Client(
        environment = 'custom',
        custom_url = 'https://example.com',)
      ```

    - Ruby

      ```ruby
      Square::Client.new(
        environment: 'custom',
        custom_url: 'https://example.com'
      });
      ```


* **Square .NET SDK:**

  Square has overridden the `Equals` and `GetHashCode` methods for models:

  * In the `Equals` override, Square has implemented a field-level comparison.
  * The Square `GetHashCode` override now ensures that hashes are deterministic and unique for each object.

* **Square Node.js SDK:**

  Endpoints that return 64-bit integers now return a `BigInt` object instead of a `Number` object.


* **Connect Node.js SDK:** (deprecated)

  The deprecated Connect Node.js SDK is in the security [maintenance state.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/api-lifecycle#maintenance) It does not receive any bug fixes or API updates from the Square version 2021-02-26 release. However, the SDK will receive support and security patches until it is retired (end of life) in the second quarter of 2021. For more information, including steps for migrating to the [Square Node.js SDK,](https://github.com/square/square-nodejs-sdk) see the [Connect SDK README.](https://github.com/square/connect-nodejs-sdk/blob/master/README.md)

## Documentation updates

* **Get Started topic.** Revised the [Get Started](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/get-started) experience. In addition to clarifications, it now includes the use of the Square Sandbox and API Explorer. These are the tools and environments developers use to explore Square APIs.


## Version 8.1.0.20210121 (2021-01-21T00:00)
## Existing API updates

* **Invoices API:** (beta)

  The `InvoicePaymentRequest.request_method` field is deprecated, and its current options are separated into two new fields that better represent their scope:
  * `Invoice.delivery_method` specifies how Square should send invoices, reminders, and receipts to the customer.
  * `InvoicePaymentRequest.automatic_payment_source` specifies the payment method for an automatic payment.

  As part of this change, the [InvoiceDeliveryMethod](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-01-21/enums/InvoiceDeliveryMethod) and [InvoiceAutomaticPaymentSource](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-01-21/enums/InvoiceAutomaticPaymentSource) enums are added and the `InvoiceRequestMethod` enum is deprecated.

  The Invoices API will continue to accept `request_method` in create and update requests until the field is retired, but starting in this version, `request_method` is not included in returned `Invoice` objects.

  * CatalogModifier &mdash; Two fields added:
     * `ordinal` to support custom ordering in a modifier list

  * OrderLineItem type &mdash; There are two changes:
    * The `taxes` field that was previously deprecated is no longer available. Instead, you now use the `OrderLineItem.applied_taxes` field. This also now requires that you set the `OrderLineItemTax.scope` field.
    * The `discounts` field that was previously deprecated is no longer available. Instead, you now use the `OrderLineItem.applied_discounts` field. This also now requires that you set the `OrderLineItemDiscount.scope` field.
