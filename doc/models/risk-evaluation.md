# Risk Evaluation

Represents fraud risk information for the associated payment.

When you take a payment through Square's Payments API (using the `CreatePayment`
endpoint), Square evaluates it and assigns a risk level to the payment. Sellers
can use this information to determine the course of action (for example,
provide the goods/services or refund the payment).
