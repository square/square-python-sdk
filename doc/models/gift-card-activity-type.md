| `ACTIVATE` | Activated a gift card with a balance. When a gift card is activated, Square changes<br>the gift card state from `PENDING` to `ACTIVE`. A gift card must be in the `ACTIVE` state<br>to be used for other balance-changing activities. |

| `ADJUST_DECREMENT` | Deducted money from a gift card outside of a typical `REDEEM` activity flow. |
| `REFUND` | Added money to a gift card from a refunded transaction. A `REFUND` activity might be linked to<br>a Square payment, depending on how the payment and refund are processed.
