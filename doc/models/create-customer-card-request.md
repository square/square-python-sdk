## Structure

`Create Customer Card Request`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `card_nonce` | `string` | Required | A card nonce representing the credit card to link to the customer.<br><br>Card nonces are generated by the Square payment form when customers enter<br>their card information. For more information, see<br>[Walkthrough: Integrate Square Payments in a Website](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/take-card-payment).<br><br>__NOTE:__ Card nonces generated by digital wallets (such as Apple Pay)<br>cannot be used to create a customer card. |
| `billing_address` | [`Address`](/doc/models/address.md) | Optional | Represents a postal address in a country. The address format is based<br>on an [open-source library from Google](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput). For more information,<br>see [AddressValidationMetadata](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata).<br>This format has dedicated fields for four address components: postal code,<br>locality (city), administrative district (state, prefecture, or province), and<br>sublocality (town or village). These components have dedicated fields in the<br>`Address` object because software sometimes behaves differently based on them.<br>For example, sales tax software may charge different amounts of sales tax<br>based on the postal code, and some software is only available in<br>certain states due to compliance reasons.<br><br>For the remaining address components, the `Address` type provides the<br>`address_line_1` and `address_line_2` fields for free-form data entry.<br>These fields are free-form because the remaining address components have<br>too many variations around the world and typical software does not parse<br>these components. These fields enable users to enter anything they want.<br><br>Note that, in the current implementation, all other `Address` type fields are blank.<br>These include `address_line_3`, `sublocality_2`, `sublocality_3`,<br>`administrative_district_level_2`, `administrative_district_level_3`,<br>`first_name`, `last_name`, and `organization`.<br><br>When it comes to localization, the seller's language preferences<br>(see [Language preferences](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api#location-specific-and-seller-level-language-preferences))<br>are ignored for addresses. Even though Square products (such as Square Point of Sale<br>and the Seller Dashboard) mostly use a seller's language preference in<br>communication, when it comes to addresses, they will use English for a US address,<br>Japanese for an address in Japan, and so on. |
| `cardholder_name` | `string` | Optional | The full name printed on the credit card. |
| `verification_token` | `string` | Optional | An identifying token generated by [Payments.verifyBuyer()](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments/objects/Payments#Payments.verifyBuyer).<br>Verification tokens encapsulate customer device information and 3-D Secure<br>challenge results to indicate that Square has verified the buyer identity. |
