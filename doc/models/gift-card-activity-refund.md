## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `redeem_activity_id` | `str` | Optional | The ID of the refunded `REDEEM` gift card activity. Square populates this field if the<br>`payment_id` in the corresponding [RefundPayment](api-endpoint:Refunds-RefundPayment) request<br>represents a gift card redemption.<br><br>For applications that use a custom payment processing system, this field is required when creating<br>a `REFUND` activity. The provided `REDEEM` activity ID must be linked to the same gift card. |
| `amount_money` | [`Money`](../../doc/models/money.md) | Optional | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. |
| `reference_id` | `str` | Optional | A client-specified ID that associates the gift card activity with an entity in another system. |
| `payment_id` | `str` | Optional | The ID of the refunded payment. Square populates this field if the refund is for a<br>payment processed by Square. This field matches the `payment_id` in the corresponding<br>[RefundPayment](api-endpoint:Refunds-RefundPayment) request. |
