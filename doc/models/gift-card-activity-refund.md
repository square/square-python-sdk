## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `redeem_activity_id` | `string` | Optional | The ID of the refunded `REDEEM` gift card activity. Square populates this field if the<br>`payment_id` in the corresponding [RefundPayment](../../doc/api/refunds.md#refund-payment) request<br>represents a redemption made by the same gift card. Note that you must use `RefundPayment` when refunding a<br>gift card payment made using the Payments API, Square Point of Sale, or the Seller Dashboard to the same gift card.<br><br>Applications that use a custom payment processing system can use this field in a<br>[CreateGiftCardActivity](../../doc/api/gift-card-activities.md#create-gift-card-activity)<br>request to link a refund with a `REDEEM` activity for the same gift card. |
| `amount_money` | [`Money`](../../doc/models/money.md) | Optional | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. |
| `reference_id` | `string` | Optional | A client-specified ID that associates the gift card activity with an order, payment, or other entity.<br><br>This field can be used to track information related to Square entities or entities in another system. |
| `payment_id` | `string` | Optional | The ID of the refunded payment. Square populates this field if the refund is for a<br>payment processed by Square and one of the following conditions is true:<br><br>- The Refunds API is used to refund a gift card payment to the same gift card.<br>- A seller initiated the refund from Square Point of Sale or the Seller Dashboard. The payment source can be the<br>  same gift card or a cross-tender payment from a credit card or a different gift card. |
