The value cannot be changed.<br><br>For example, a payment `due_date` of 2021-03-09 with a `timezone` of America/Los\_Angeles<br>becomes overdue at midnight on March 9 in America/Los\_Angeles (which equals a UTC timestamp<br>of 2021-03-10T08:00:00Z). |

For more information,<br>see [Payment conditions](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/invoices-api/overview#payment-conditions).<br><br>For countries other than France, Square returns an `INVALID_REQUEST_ERROR` with a `BAD_REQUEST` code and<br>"Payment conditions are not supported for this location's country" detail if this field is included in `CreateInvoice` or `UpdateInvoice` requests.<br>**Constraints**: *Minimum Length*: `1`, *Maximum Length*: `2000` |
