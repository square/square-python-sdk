## Structure

`Batch Upsert Catalog Objects Request`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `idempotency_key` | `string` | A value you specify that uniquely identifies this<br>request among all your requests. A common way to create<br>a valid idempotency key is to use a Universally unique<br>identifier (UUID).<br><br>If you're unsure whether a particular request was successful,<br>you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without<br>worrying about creating duplicate objects.<br><br>See [Idempotency](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/basics/api101/idempotency) for more information. |
| `batches` | [`List of Catalog Object Batch`](/doc/models/catalog-object-batch.md) | A batch of CatalogObjects to be inserted/updated atomically.<br>The objects within a batch will be inserted in an all-or-nothing fashion, i.e., if an error occurs<br>attempting to insert or update an object within a batch, the entire batch will be rejected. However, an error<br>in one batch will not affect other batches within the same request.<br><br>For each object, its `updated_at` field is ignored and replaced with a current [timestamp](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-dates), and its<br>`is_deleted` field must not be set to `true`.<br><br>To modify an existing object, supply its ID. To create a new object, use an ID starting<br>with `#`. These IDs may be used to create relationships between an object and attributes of<br>other objects that reference it. For example, you can create a CatalogItem with<br>ID `#ABC` and a CatalogItemVariation with its `item_id` attribute set to<br>`#ABC` in order to associate the CatalogItemVariation with its parent<br>CatalogItem.<br><br>Any `#`-prefixed IDs are valid only within a single atomic batch, and will be replaced by server-generated IDs.<br><br>Each batch may contain up to 1,000 objects. The total number of objects across all batches for a single request<br>may not exceed 10,000. If either of these limits is violated, an error will be returned and no objects will<br>be inserted or updated. |
