| `date_time_filter` | [`Search Orders Date Time Filter`](/doc/models/search-orders-date-time-filter.md) | Optional | Filter for `Order` objects based on whether their `CREATED_AT`,<br>`CLOSED_AT` or `UPDATED_AT` timestamps fall within a specified time range.<br>You can specify the time range and which timestamp to filter for. You can filter<br>for only one time range at a time.<br><br>For each time range, the start time and end time are inclusive. If the end time<br>is absent, it defaults to the time of the first request for the cursor.<br><br>__Important:__ If you use the DateTimeFilter in a SearchOrders query,<br>you must also set the `sort_field` in [OrdersSort](#type-searchorderordersort)<br>to the same field you filter for. For example, if you set the `CLOSED_AT` field<br>in DateTimeFilter, you must also set the `sort_field` in SearchOrdersSort to<br>`CLOSED_AT`. Otherwise, SearchOrders will throw an error.<br>[Learn more about filtering orders by time range](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/manage-orders#important-note-on-filtering-orders-by-time-range). |
