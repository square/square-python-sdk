| `amount_money` | [`Money`](../../doc/models/money.md) | Required | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. |
| `payment_id` | `string` | Optional | When the Square Payments API is used, Redeem is not called on the Gift Cards API.<br>However, when Square reads a Redeem activity from the Gift Cards API, developers need to know the<br>associated `payment_id`. |
| `reference_id` | `string` | Optional | A client-specified ID to associate an entity, in another system, with this gift card<br>activity. This can be used to track the order or payment related information when the Square Orders<br>API is not being used. |
