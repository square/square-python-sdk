# Invoice Recipient

Represents a snapshot of customer data. This object stores customer data that is displayed on the invoice
and that Square uses to deliver the invoice.

When you provide a customer ID for a draft invoice, Square retrieves the associated customer profile and populates
the remaining `InvoiceRecipient` fields. You cannot update these fields after the invoice is published.
Square updates the customer ID in response to a merge operation, but does not update other fields.

## Structure

`Invoice Recipient`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `customer_id` | `string` | Optional | The ID of the customer. This is the customer profile ID that<br>you provide when creating a draft invoice.<br>**Constraints**: *Minimum Length*: `1`, *Maximum Length*: `255` |
| `given_name` | `string` | Optional | The recipient's given (that is, first) name. |
| `family_name` | `string` | Optional | The recipient's family (that is, last) name. |
| `email_address` | `string` | Optional | The recipient's email address. |
| `address` | [`Address`](/doc/models/address.md) | Optional | Represents a postal address in a country. The address format is based<br>on an [open-source library from Google](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput). For more information,<br>see [AddressValidationMetadata](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata).<br>This format has dedicated fields for four address components: postal code,<br>locality (city), administrative district (state, prefecture, or province), and<br>sublocality (town or village). These components have dedicated fields in the<br>`Address` object because software sometimes behaves differently based on them.<br>For example, sales tax software may charge different amounts of sales tax<br>based on the postal code, and some software is only available in<br>certain states due to compliance reasons.<br><br>For the remaining address components, the `Address` type provides the<br>`address_line_1` and `address_line_2` fields for free-form data entry.<br>These fields are free-form because the remaining address components have<br>too many variations around the world and typical software does not parse<br>these components. These fields enable users to enter anything they want.<br><br>Note that, in the current implementation, all other `Address` type fields are blank.<br>These include `address_line_3`, `sublocality_2`, `sublocality_3`,<br>`administrative_district_level_2`, `administrative_district_level_3`,<br>`first_name`, `last_name`, and `organization`.<br><br>When it comes to localization, the seller's language preferences<br>(see [Language preferences](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api#location-specific-and-seller-level-language-preferences))<br>are ignored for addresses. Even though Square products (such as Square Point of Sale<br>and the Seller Dashboard) mostly use a seller's language preference in<br>communication, when it comes to addresses, they will use English for a US address,<br>Japanese for an address in Japan, and so on. |
| `phone_number` | `string` | Optional | The recipient's phone number. |
| `company_name` | `string` | Optional | The name of the recipient's company. |
| `tax_ids` | [`Invoice Recipient Tax Ids`](/doc/models/invoice-recipient-tax-ids.md) | Optional | Represents the tax IDs for an invoice recipient. The country of the seller account determines<br>whether the corresponding `tax_ids` field is available for the customer. For more information,<br>see [Invoice recipient tax IDs](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/invoices-api/overview#recipient-tax-ids). |
