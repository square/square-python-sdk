## Order Return Discount

Represents a discount being returned that applies to one or more return line items in an
order.

Fixed-amount, order-scoped discounts are distributed across all non-zero return line item totals.
The amount distributed to each return line item is relative to that item’s contribution to the
order subtotal.
