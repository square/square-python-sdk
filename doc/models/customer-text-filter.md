## Customer Text Filter

A filter to select customers based on exact or fuzzy matching of
customer attributes against a specified query. Depending on customer attributes, 
the filter can be case sensitive. This filter can be either exact or fuzzy. It cannot be both.

### Structure

`CustomerTextFilter`

### Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `exact` | `string` | Optional | Use the exact filter to select customers whose attributes match exactly the specified query. |
| `fuzzy` | `string` | Optional | Use the fuzzy filter to select customers whose attributes match the specified query <br>in a fuzzy manner. When the fuzzy option is used, search queries are tokenized, and then <br>each query token must be matched somewhere in the searched attribute. For single token queries, <br>this is effectively the same behavior as a partial match operation. |

### Example (as JSON)

```json
{
  "exact": "exact0",
  "fuzzy": "fuzzy4"
}
```
