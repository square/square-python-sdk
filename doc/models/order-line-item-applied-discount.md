# Order Line Item Applied Discount

Represents an applied portion of a discount to a line item in an order.

Order scoped discounts have automatically applied discounts present for each line item.
Line-item scoped discounts must have applied discounts added manually for any applicable line
items. The corresponding applied money is automatically computed based on participating
line items.
