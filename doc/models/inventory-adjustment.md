| `to_state` | [`str (Inventory State)`](/doc/models/inventory-state.md) | Optional | Indicates the state of a tracked item quantity in the lifecycle of goods. |
| `location_id` | `string` | Optional | The Square ID of the [Location](#type-location) where the related<br>quantity of items are being tracked. |
| `catalog_object_id` | `string` | Optional | The Square generated ID of the<br>[CatalogObject](#type-catalogobject) being tracked. |

If a Point of Sale app or Dashboard attempts to read a<br>decimal quantity on inventory counts or adjustments, the quantity will be rounded<br>down to the nearest integer. For example, `2.5` will become `2`, and `-2.5`<br>will become `-3`.<br><br>Read [Decimal Quantities (BETA)](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/what-it-does#decimal-quantities)<br>for more information. |
| `total_price_money` | [`Money`](/doc/models/money.md) | Optional | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned. |

| `created_at` | `string` | Optional | A read-only timestamp in RFC 3339 format that indicates when Square<br>received the adjustment. |
| `source` | [`Source Application`](/doc/models/source-application.md) | Optional | Provides information about the application used to generate an inventory<br>change. |
