## Checkout

Square Checkout lets merchants accept online payments for supported
payment types using a checkout workflow hosted on squareup.com.

### Structure

`Checkout`

### Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | Optional | ID generated by Square Checkout when a new checkout is requested. |
| `checkout_page_url` | `string` | Optional | The URL that the buyer's browser should be redirected to after the<br>checkout is completed. |
| `ask_for_shipping_address` | `bool` | Optional | If `true`, Square Checkout will collect shipping information on your<br>behalf and store that information with the transaction information in your<br>Square Dashboard.<br><br>Default: `false`. |
| `merchant_support_email` | `string` | Optional | The email address to display on the Square Checkout confirmation page<br>and confirmation email that the buyer can use to contact the merchant.<br><br>If this value is not set, the confirmation page and email will display the<br>primary email address associated with the merchant's Square account.<br><br>Default: none; only exists if explicitly set. |
| `pre_populate_buyer_email` | `string` | Optional | If provided, the buyer's email is pre-populated on the checkout page<br>as an editable text field.<br><br>Default: none; only exists if explicitly set. |

| `redirect_url` | `string` | Optional | The URL to redirect to after checkout is completed with `checkoutId`,<br>Square's `orderId`, `transactionId`, and `referenceId` appended as URL<br>parameters.
