# Checkout

Square Checkout lets merchants accept online payments for supported
payment types using a checkout workflow hosted on squareup.com.

## Structure

`Checkout`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | Optional | ID generated by Square Checkout when a new checkout is requested. |
| `checkout_page_url` | `string` | Optional | The URL that the buyer's browser should be redirected to after the<br>checkout is completed. |
| `ask_for_shipping_address` | `bool` | Optional | If `true`, Square Checkout will collect shipping information on your<br>behalf and store that information with the transaction information in your<br>Square Dashboard.<br><br>Default: `false`. |
| `merchant_support_email` | `string` | Optional | The email address to display on the Square Checkout confirmation page<br>and confirmation email that the buyer can use to contact the merchant.<br><br>If this value is not set, the confirmation page and email will display the<br>primary email address associated with the merchant's Square account.<br><br>Default: none; only exists if explicitly set. |
| `pre_populate_buyer_email` | `string` | Optional | If provided, the buyer's email is pre-populated on the checkout page<br>as an editable text field.<br><br>Default: none; only exists if explicitly set. |
| `pre_populate_shipping_address` | [`Address`](/doc/models/address.md) | Optional | Represents a postal address in a country. The address format is based<br>on an [open-source library from Google](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput). For more information,<br>see [AddressValidationMetadata](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata).<br>This format has dedicated fields for four address components: postal code,<br>locality (city), administrative district (state, prefecture, or province), and<br>sublocality (town or village). These components have dedicated fields in the<br>`Address` object because software sometimes behaves differently based on them.<br>For example, sales tax software may charge different amounts of sales tax<br>based on the postal code, and some software is only available in<br>certain states due to compliance reasons.<br><br>For the remaining address components, the `Address` type provides the<br>`address_line_1` and `address_line_2` fields for free-form data entry.<br>These fields are free-form because the remaining address components have<br>too many variations around the world and typical software does not parse<br>these components. These fields enable users to enter anything they want.<br><br>Note that, in the current implementation, all other `Address` type fields are blank.<br>These include `address_line_3`, `sublocality_2`, `sublocality_3`,<br>`administrative_district_level_2`, `administrative_district_level_3`,<br>`first_name`, `last_name`, and `organization`.<br><br>When it comes to localization, the seller's language preferences<br>(see [Language preferences](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api#location-specific-and-seller-level-language-preferences))<br>are ignored for addresses. Even though Square products (such as Square Point of Sale<br>and the Seller Dashboard) mostly use a seller's language preference in<br>communication, when it comes to addresses, they will use English for a US address,<br>Japanese for an address in Japan, and so on. |
| `redirect_url` | `string` | Optional | The URL to redirect to after checkout is completed with `checkoutId`,<br>Square's `orderId`, `transactionId`, and `referenceId` appended as URL<br>parameters. For example, if the provided redirect_url is<br>`http://www.example.com/order-complete`, a successful transaction redirects<br>the customer to:<br><br><pre><code>http://www.example.com/order-complete?checkoutId=xxxxxx&amp;orderId=xxxxxx&amp;referenceId=xxxxxx&amp;transactionId=xxxxxx</code></pre><br>If you do not provide a redirect URL, Square Checkout will display an order<br>confirmation page on your behalf; however Square strongly recommends that<br>you provide a redirect URL so you can verify the transaction results and<br>finalize the order through your existing/normal confirmation workflow. |
| `order` | [`Order`](/doc/models/order.md) | Optional | Contains all information related to a single order to process with Square,<br>including line items that specify the products to purchase. `Order` objects also<br>include information about any associated tenders, refunds, and returns.<br><br>All Connect V2 Transactions have all been converted to Orders including all associated<br>itemization data. |
| `created_at` | `string` | Optional | The time when the checkout was created, in RFC 3339 format. |
| `additional_recipients` | [`List of Additional Recipient`](/doc/models/additional-recipient.md) | Optional | Additional recipients (other than the merchant) receiving a portion of this checkout.<br>For example, fees assessed on the purchase by a third party integration. |
