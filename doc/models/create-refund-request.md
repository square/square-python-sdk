`CreateRefundRequest`

### Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `idempotency_key` | `string` |  | A value you specify that uniquely identifies this<br>refund among refunds you've created for the tender.<br><br>If you're unsure whether a particular refund succeeded,<br>you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without<br>worrying about duplicating the refund.<br><br>See [Idempotency keys](#idempotencykeys) for more information. |
| `tender_id` | `string` |  | The ID of the tender to refund.<br><br>A [`Transaction`](#type-transaction) has one or more `tenders` (i.e., methods<br>of payment) associated with it, and you refund each tender separately with<br>the Connect API. |
| `reason` | `string` | Optional | A description of the reason for the refund.<br><br>Default value: `Refund via API` |
| `amount_money` | [`Money`](/doc/models/money.md) |  | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. |
