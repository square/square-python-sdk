Do not use metadata to store any sensitive information (personally<br>identifiable information, card details, etc.).<br><br>Keys written by applications must be 60 characters or less and must be in the character set<br>`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`. Entries may also include metadata generated by Square. These keys are prefixed<br>with a namespace, separated from the key with a ':' character.<br><br>Values have a max length of 255 characters.<br><br>An application may have up to 10 entries per metadata field.<br><br>Entries written by applications are private and can only be read or modified by the same<br>application.<br><br>See [Metadata](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/metadata) for more information. |
