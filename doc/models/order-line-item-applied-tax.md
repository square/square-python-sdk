## Order Line Item Applied Tax

Represents an applied portion of a tax to a line item in an order.

Order-scoped taxes automatically include the applied taxes in each line item.
Line item taxes must be referenced from any applicable line items.
The corresponding applied money is automatically computed, based on the
set of participating line items.
