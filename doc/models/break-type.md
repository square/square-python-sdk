## Break Type

A defined break template that sets an expectation for possible `Break`
instances on a `Shift`.

### Structure

`BreakType`

### Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | Optional | UUID for this object. |
| `location_id` | `string` |  | The ID of the business location this type of break applies to. |
| `break_name` | `string` |  | A human-readable name for this type of break. Will be displayed to<br>employees in Square products. |
| `expected_duration` | `string` |  | Format: RFC-3339 P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S. The expected length of<br>this break. Precision below minutes is truncated. |
| `is_paid` | `bool` |  | Whether this break counts towards time worked for compensation<br>purposes. |
| `version` | `int` | Optional | Used for resolving concurrency issues; request will fail if version<br>provided does not match server version at time of request. If a value is not<br>provided, Square's servers execute a "blind" write; potentially<br>overwriting another writer's data. |
| `created_at` | `string` | Optional | A read-only timestamp in RFC 3339 format. |
| `updated_at` | `string` | Optional | A read-only timestamp in RFC 3339 format. |
