### Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |

| `id` | `string` | Optional | UUID for this object |
| `start_at` | `string` |  | RFC 3339; follows same timezone info as `Shift`. Precision up to<br>the minute is respected; seconds are truncated. |
| `end_at` | `string` | Optional | RFC 3339; follows same timezone info as `Shift`. Precision up to<br>the minute is respected; seconds are truncated.
