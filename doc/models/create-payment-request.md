| `delay_duration` | `string` | Optional | The duration of time after the payment's creation when Square automatically cancels the<br>payment. This automatic cancellation applies only to payments that don't reach a terminal state<br>(COMPLETED, CANCELED, or FAILED) before the `delay_duration` time period.<br><br>This parameter should be specified as a time duration, in RFC 3339 format, with a minimum value<br>of 1 minute.<br><br>Notes:<br>This feature is only supported for card payments. This parameter can only be set for a delayed<br>capture payment (`autocomplete=false`).<br><br>Default:<br><br>- Card Present payments: "PT36H" (36 hours) from the creation time.<br>- Card Not Present payments: "P7D" (7 days) from the creation time. |
| `autocomplete` | `bool` | Optional | If set to `true`, this payment will be completed when possible. If<br>set to `false`, this payment will be held in an approved state until either<br>explicitly completed (captured) or canceled (voided).

| `order_id` | `string` | Optional | Associate a previously created order with this payment |

| `verification_token` | `string` | Optional | An identifying token generated by `SqPaymentForm.verifyBuyer()`.<br>Verification tokens encapsulate customer device information and 3-D Secure<br>challenge results to indicate that Square has verified the buyer identity.<br><br>See the [SCA Overview](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/sca-overview). |
| `accept_partial_authorization` | `bool` | Optional | If set to true and charging a Square Gift Card, a payment may be returned with<br>amount_money equal to less than what was requested.  Example, a request for $20 when charging<br>a Square Gift Card with balance of $5 wil result in an APPROVED payment of $5.  You may choose<br>to prompt the buyer for an additional payment to cover the remainder, or cancel the gift card<br>payment.  Cannot be `true` when `autocomplete = true`.<br><br>For more information, see<br>[Partial amount with Square gift cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments#partial-payment-gift-card).<br><br>Default: false |
