|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `source_id` | `string` |  | The ID for the source of funds for this payment. This can be a nonce<br>generated by the Square payment form or a card on file made with the Customers API. |
| `idempotency_key` | `string` |  | A unique string that identifies this `CreatePayment` request. Keys can be any valid string<br>but must be unique for every `CreatePayment` request.<br><br>Max: 45 characters<br><br>Note: The number of allowed characters might be less than the stated maximum, if multi-byte<br>characters are used.<br><br>For more information, see [Idempotency](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/working-with-apis/idempotency). |
| `amount_money` | [`Money`](/doc/models/money.md) |  | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. |
| `tip_money` | [`Money`](/doc/models/money.md) | Optional | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. |
| `app_fee_money` | [`Money`](/doc/models/money.md) | Optional | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. |
| `delay_duration` | `string` | Optional | The duration of time after the payment's creation when Square automatically cancels the<br>payment. This automatic cancellation applies only to payments that do not reach a terminal state<br>(COMPLETED, CANCELED, or FAILED) before the `delay_duration` time period.<br><br>This parameter should be specified as a time duration, in RFC 3339 format, with a minimum value<br>of 1 minute.<br><br>Note: This feature is only supported for card payments. This parameter can only be set for a delayed<br>capture payment (`autocomplete=false`).<br><br>Default:<br><br>- Card-present payments: "PT36H" (36 hours) from the creation time.<br>- Card-not-present payments: "P7D" (7 days) from the creation time. |
| `autocomplete` | `bool` | Optional | If set to `true`, this payment will be completed when possible. If<br>set to `false`, this payment is held in an approved state until either<br>explicitly completed (captured) or canceled (voided). For more information, see<br>[Delayed capture](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments#delayed-payments).<br><br>Default: true |
| `order_id` | `string` | Optional | Associates a previously created order with this payment. |
| `customer_id` | `string` | Optional | The [Customer](#type-customer) ID of the customer associated with the payment.<br><br>This is required if the `source_id` refers to a card on file created using the Customers API. |
| `location_id` | `string` | Optional | The location ID to associate with the payment. If not specified, the default location is<br>used. |
| `reference_id` | `string` | Optional | A user-defined ID to associate with the payment.<br><br>You can use this field to associate the payment to an entity in an external system<br>(for example, you might specify an order ID that is generated by a third-party shopping cart).<br><br>Limit 40 characters. |
| `verification_token` | `string` | Optional | An identifying token generated by `SqPaymentForm.verifyBuyer()`.<br>Verification tokens encapsulate customer device information and 3-D Secure<br>challenge results to indicate that Square has verified the buyer identity.<br><br>For more information, see [SCA Overview](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/sca-overview). |
| `accept_partial_authorization` | `bool` | Optional | If set to `true` and charging a Square Gift Card, a payment might be returned with<br>`amount_money` equal to less than what was requested. For example, a request for $20 when charging<br>a Square Gift Card with a balance of $5 results in an APPROVED payment of $5. You might choose<br>to prompt the buyer for an additional payment to cover the remainder or cancel the Gift Card<br>payment. This field cannot be `true` when `autocomplete = true`.<br><br>For more information, see<br>[Partial amount with Square Gift Cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments#partial-payment-gift-card).<br><br>Default: false |
| `buyer_email_address` | `string` | Optional | The buyer's email address. |
| `billing_address` | [`Address`](/doc/models/address.md) | Optional | Represents a physical address. |
| `shipping_address` | [`Address`](/doc/models/address.md) | Optional | Represents a physical address. |
| `note` | `string` | Optional | An optional note to be entered by the developer when creating a payment.<br><br>Limit 500 characters. |
| `statement_description_identifier` | `string` | Optional | Optional additional payment information to include on the customer's card statement<br>as part of the statement description. This can be, for example, an invoice number, ticket number,<br>or short description that uniquely identifies the purchase.<br><br>Note that the `statement_description_identifier` might get truncated on the statement description<br>to fit the required information including the Square identifier (SQ *) and name of the<br>seller taking the payment. |
