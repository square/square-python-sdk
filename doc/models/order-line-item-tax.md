## Order Line Item Tax

Represents a tax that applies to one or more line item in the order.

Fixed-amount, order-scoped taxes are distributed across all non-zero line item totals.
The amount distributed to each line item is relative to the amount the item
contributes to the order subtotal.

Entries may also include metadata generated by Square.
