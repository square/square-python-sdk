## Time Range

Represents a generic time range. The start and end values are
represented in RFC 3339 format. Time ranges are customized to be
inclusive or exclusive based on the needs of a particular endpoint.
Refer to the relevant endpoint-specific documentation to determine
how time ranges are handled.
