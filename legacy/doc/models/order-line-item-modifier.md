`Order Line Item Modifier`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uid` | `str` | Optional | A unique ID that identifies the modifier only within this order.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `60` |
| `catalog_object_id` | `str` | Optional | The catalog object ID referencing [CatalogModifier](entity:CatalogModifier).<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `192` |
| `catalog_version` | `long\|int` | Optional | The version of the catalog object that this modifier references. |

| `quantity` | `str` | Optional | The quantity of the line item modifier. The modifier quantity can be 0 or more.<br>For example, suppose a restaurant offers a cheeseburger on the menu. When a buyer orders<br>this item, the restaurant records the purchase by creating an `Order` object with a line item<br>for a burger. The line item includes a line item modifier: the name is cheese and the quantity<br>is 1. The buyer has the option to order extra cheese (or no cheese). If the buyer chooses<br>the extra cheese option, the modifier quantity increases to 2. If the buyer does not want<br>any cheese, the modifier quantity is set to 0. |
| `base_price_money` | [`Money`](../../doc/models/money.md) | Optional | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. |
| `total_price_money` | [`Money`](../../doc/models/money.md) | Optional | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts.

| `metadata` | `Dict[str, str]` | Optional | Application-defined data attached to this order. Metadata fields are intended<br>to store descriptive references or associations with an entity in another system or store brief<br>information about the object. Square does not process this field; it only stores and returns it<br>in relevant API calls. Do not use metadata to store any sensitive information (such as personally<br>identifiable information or card details).<br><br>Keys written by applications must be 60 characters or less and must be in the character set<br>`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`. Entries can also include metadata generated by Square. These keys are prefixed<br>with a namespace, separated from the key with a ':' character.<br><br>Values have a maximum length of 255 characters.<br><br>An application can have up to 10 entries per metadata field.<br><br>Entries written by applications are private and can only be read or modified by the same<br>application.<br><br>For more information, see  [Metadata](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/metadata). |
