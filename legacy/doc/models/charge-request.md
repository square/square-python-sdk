| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `idempotency_key` | `str` | Required | A value you specify that uniquely identifies this<br>transaction among transactions you've created.<br><br>If you're unsure whether a particular transaction succeeded,<br>you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without<br>worrying about double-charging the buyer.<br><br>See [Idempotency keys](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/working-with-apis/idempotency) for more information.<br>**Constraints**: *Minimum Length*: `1`, *Maximum Length*: `192` |
| `amount_money` | [`Money`](../../doc/models/money.md) | Required | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. |
| `card_nonce` | `str` | Optional | A payment token generated from the [Card.tokenize()](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments/objects/Card#Card.tokenize) that represents the card<br>to charge.<br><br>The application that provides a payment token to this endpoint must be the<br>_same application_ that generated the payment token with the Web Payments SDK.<br>Otherwise, the nonce is invalid.<br><br>Do not provide a value for this field if you provide a value for<br>`customer_card_id`.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `192` |
| `customer_card_id` | `str` | Optional | The ID of the customer card on file to charge.

| `delay_capture` | `bool` | Optional | If `true`, the request will only perform an Auth on the provided<br>card. You can then later perform either a Capture (with the<br>[CaptureTransaction](api-endpoint:Transactions-CaptureTransaction) endpoint) or a Void<br>(with the [VoidTransaction](api-endpoint:Transactions-VoidTransaction) endpoint).<br><br>Default value: `false` |
| `reference_id` | `str` | Optional | An optional ID you can associate with the transaction for your own<br>purposes (such as to associate the transaction with an entity ID in your<br>own database).<br><br>This value cannot exceed 40 characters.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `40` |
| `note` | `str` | Optional | An optional note to associate with the transaction.<br><br>This value cannot exceed 60 characters.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `60` |

| `buyer_email_address` | `str` | Optional | The buyer's email address, if available. This value is optional,<br>but this transaction is ineligible for chargeback protection if it is not<br>provided. |
| `order_id` | `str` | Optional | The ID of the order to associate with this transaction.<br><br>If you provide this value, the `amount_money` value of your request must<br>__exactly match__ the value of the order's `total_money` field.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `192` |
| `additional_recipients` | [`List Charge Request Additional Recipient`](../../doc/models/charge-request-additional-recipient.md) | Optional | The basic primitive of multi-party transaction. The value is optional.<br>The transaction facilitated by you can be split from here.<br><br>If you provide this value, the `amount_money` value in your additional_recipients<br>must not be more than 90% of the `amount_money` value in the charge request.<br>The `location_id` must be the valid location of the app owner merchant.<br><br>This field requires the `PAYMENTS_WRITE_ADDITIONAL_RECIPIENTS` OAuth permission.<br><br>This field is currently not supported in sandbox. |
