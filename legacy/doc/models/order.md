| `source` | [`Order Source`](../../doc/models/order-source.md) | Optional | Represents the origination details of an order. |
| `customer_id` | `str` | Optional | The ID of the [customer](../../doc/models/customer.md) associated with the order.<br><br>You should specify a `customer_id` on the order (or the payment) to ensure that transactions<br>are reliably linked to customers. Omitting this field might result in the creation of new<br>[instant profiles](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/what-it-does#instant-profiles).<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `191` |
| `line_items` | [`List Order Line Item`](../../doc/models/order-line-item.md) | Optional | The line items included in the order. |

For taxes with `LINE_ITEM` scope, an<br>`OrderLineItemAppliedTax` must be added to each line item that the tax applies to. For taxes<br>with `ORDER` scope, the server generates an `OrderLineItemAppliedTax` for every line item.<br><br>On reads, each tax in the list includes the total amount of that tax applied to the order.<br><br>__IMPORTANT__: If `LINE_ITEM` scope is set on any taxes in this field, using the deprecated<br>`line_items.taxes` field results in an error. Use `line_items.applied_taxes`<br>instead. |
| `discounts` | [`List Order Line Item Discount`](../../doc/models/order-line-item-discount.md) | Optional | The list of all discounts associated with the order.<br><br>Discounts can be scoped to either `ORDER` or `LINE_ITEM`. For discounts scoped to `LINE_ITEM`,<br>an `OrderLineItemAppliedDiscount` must be added to each line item that the discount applies to.<br>For discounts with `ORDER` scope, the server generates an `OrderLineItemAppliedDiscount`<br>for every line item.<br><br>__IMPORTANT__: If `LINE_ITEM` scope is set on any discounts in this field, using the deprecated<br>`line_items.discounts` field results in an error. Use `line_items.applied_discounts`<br>instead. |

| `returns` | [`List Order Return`](../../doc/models/order-return.md) | Optional | A collection of items from sale orders being returned in this one. Normally part of an<br>itemized return or exchange. There is exactly one `Return` object per sale `Order` being<br>referenced. |
| `return_amounts` | [`Order Money Amounts`](../../doc/models/order-money-amounts.md) | Optional | A collection of various money amounts. |
| `net_amounts` | [`Order Money Amounts`](../../doc/models/order-money-amounts.md) | Optional | A collection of various money amounts. |

| `refunds` | [`List Refund`](../../doc/models/refund.md) | Optional | The refunds that are part of this order. |
| `metadata` | `Dict[str, str]` | Optional | Application-defined data attached to this order. Metadata fields are intended<br>to store descriptive references or associations with an entity in another system or store brief<br>information about the object. Square does not process this field; it only stores and returns it<br>in relevant API calls. Do not use metadata to store any sensitive information (such as personally<br>identifiable information or card details).<br><br>Keys written by applications must be 60 characters or less and must be in the character set<br>`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`. Entries can also include metadata generated by Square. These keys are prefixed<br>with a namespace, separated from the key with a ':' character.<br><br>Values have a maximum length of 255 characters.<br><br>An application can have up to 10 entries per metadata field.<br><br>Entries written by applications are private and can only be read or modified by the same<br>application.<br><br>For more information, see  [Metadata](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/metadata). |

| `version` | `int` | Optional | The version number, which is incremented each time an update is committed to the order.<br>Orders not created through the API do not include a version number and<br>therefore cannot be updated.<br><br>[Read more about working with versions](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/manage-orders/update-orders). |
| `total_money` | [`Money`](../../doc/models/money.md) | Optional | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts.
