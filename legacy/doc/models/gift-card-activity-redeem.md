Represents details about a `REDEEM` [gift card activity type](../../doc/models/gift-card-activity-type.md).

## Structure

`Gift Card Activity Redeem`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `amount_money` | [`Money`](../../doc/models/money.md) | Required | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. |
| `payment_id` | `str` | Optional | The ID of the payment that represents the gift card redemption. Square populates this field<br>if the payment was processed by Square. |
| `reference_id` | `str` | Optional | A client-specified ID that associates the gift card activity with an entity in another system.<br><br>Applications that use a custom payment processing system can use this field to track information<br>related to an order or payment. |
| `status` | [`str (Gift Card Activity Redeem Status)`](../../doc/models/gift-card-activity-redeem-status.md) | Optional | Indicates the status of a [gift card](../../doc/models/gift-card.md) redemption. This status is relevant only for<br>redemptions made from Square products (such as Square Point of Sale) because Square products use a<br>two-state process. Gift cards redeemed using the Gift Card Activities API always have a `COMPLETED` status. |
