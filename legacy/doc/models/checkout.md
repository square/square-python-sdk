Square Checkout lets merchants accept online payments for supported
payment types using a checkout workflow hosted on squareup.com.

## Structure

`Checkout`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `str` | Optional | ID generated by Square Checkout when a new checkout is requested. |
| `checkout_page_url` | `str` | Optional | The URL that the buyer's browser should be redirected to after the<br>checkout is completed. |
| `ask_for_shipping_address` | `bool` | Optional | If `true`, Square Checkout will collect shipping information on your<br>behalf and store that information with the transaction information in your<br>Square Dashboard.<br><br>Default: `false`. |
| `merchant_support_email` | `str` | Optional | The email address to display on the Square Checkout confirmation page<br>and confirmation email that the buyer can use to contact the merchant.<br><br>If this value is not set, the confirmation page and email will display the<br>primary email address associated with the merchant's Square account.<br><br>Default: none; only exists if explicitly set. |
| `pre_populate_buyer_email` | `str` | Optional | If provided, the buyer's email is pre-populated on the checkout page<br>as an editable text field.<br><br>Default: none; only exists if explicitly set. |
| `pre_populate_shipping_address` | [`Address`](../../doc/models/address.md) | Optional | Represents a postal address in a country.<br>For more information, see [Working with Addresses](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-addresses). |
| `redirect_url` | `str` | Optional | The URL to redirect to after checkout is completed with `checkoutId`,<br>Square's `orderId`, `transactionId`, and `referenceId` appended as URL<br>parameters. For example, if the provided redirect_url is<br>`http://www.example.com/order-complete`, a successful transaction redirects<br>the customer to:<br><br><pre><code>http://www.example.com/order-complete?checkoutId=xxxxxx&amp;orderId=xxxxxx&amp;referenceId=xxxxxx&amp;transactionId=xxxxxx</code></pre><br>If you do not provide a redirect URL, Square Checkout will display an order<br>confirmation page on your behalf; however Square strongly recommends that<br>you provide a redirect URL so you can verify the transaction results and<br>finalize the order through your existing/normal confirmation workflow. |
| `order` | [`Order`](../../doc/models/order.md) | Optional | Contains all information related to a single order to process with Square,<br>including line items that specify the products to purchase. `Order` objects also<br>include information about any associated tenders, refunds, and returns.<br><br>All Connect V2 Transactions have all been converted to Orders including all associated<br>itemization data. |
| `created_at` | `str` | Optional | The time when the checkout was created, in RFC 3339 format. |
| `additional_recipients` | [`List Additional Recipient`](../../doc/models/additional-recipient.md) | Optional | Additional recipients (other than the merchant) receiving a portion of this checkout.<br>For example, fees assessed on the purchase by a third party integration. |
