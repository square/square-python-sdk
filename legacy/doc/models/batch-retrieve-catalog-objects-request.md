## Structure

`Batch Retrieve Catalog Objects Request`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `object_ids` | `List[str]` | Required | The IDs of the CatalogObjects to be retrieved. |
| `include_related_objects` | `bool` | Optional | If `true`, the response will include additional objects that are related to the<br>requested objects. Related objects are defined as any objects referenced by ID by the results in the `objects` field<br>of the response. These objects are put in the `related_objects` field. Setting this to `true` is<br>helpful when the objects are needed for immediate display to a user.<br>This process only goes one level deep. Objects referenced by the related objects will not be included. For example,<br><br>if the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItem, its associated<br>CatalogCategory objects, CatalogTax objects, CatalogImage objects and<br>CatalogModifierLists will be returned in the `related_objects` field of the<br>response. If the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItemVariation,<br>its parent CatalogItem will be returned in the `related_objects` field of<br>the response.<br><br>Default value: `false` |
| `catalog_version` | `long\|int` | Optional | The specific version of the catalog objects to be included in the response.<br>This allows you to retrieve historical versions of objects. The specified version value is matched against<br>the [CatalogObject](../../doc/models/catalog-object.md)s' `version` attribute. If not included, results will<br>be from the current version of the catalog. |
| `include_deleted_objects` | `bool` | Optional | Indicates whether to include (`true`) or not (`false`) in the response deleted objects, namely, those with the `is_deleted` attribute set to `true`. |
| `include_category_path_to_root` | `bool` | Optional | Specifies whether or not to include the `path_to_root` list for each returned category instance. The `path_to_root` list consists<br>of `CategoryPathToRootNode` objects and specifies the path that starts with the immediate parent category of the returned category<br>and ends with its root category. If the returned category is a top-level category, the `path_to_root` list is empty and is not returned<br>in the response payload. |
