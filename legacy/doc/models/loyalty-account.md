## Structure

`Loyalty Account`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `str` | Optional | The Square-assigned ID of the loyalty account.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `36` |
| `program_id` | `str` | Required | The Square-assigned ID of the [loyalty program](entity:LoyaltyProgram) to which the account belongs.<br>**Constraints**: *Minimum Length*: `1`, *Maximum Length*: `36` |
| `balance` | `int` | Optional | The available point balance in the loyalty account. If points are scheduled to expire, they are listed in the `expiring_point_deadlines` field.<br><br>Your application should be able to handle loyalty accounts that have a negative point balance (`balance` is less than 0). This might occur if a seller makes a manual adjustment or as a result of a refund or exchange. |
| `lifetime_points` | `int` | Optional | The total points accrued during the lifetime of the account. |
| `customer_id` | `str` | Optional | The Square-assigned ID of the [customer](entity:Customer) that is associated with the account. |
| `enrolled_at` | `str` | Optional | The timestamp when the buyer joined the loyalty program, in RFC 3339 format. This field is used to display the **Enrolled On** or **Member Since** date in first-party Square products.<br><br>If this field is not set in a `CreateLoyaltyAccount` request, Square populates it after the buyer's first action on their account<br>(when `AccumulateLoyaltyPoints` or `CreateLoyaltyReward` is called). In first-party flows, Square populates the field when the buyer agrees to the terms of service in Square Point of Sale.<br><br>This field is typically specified in a `CreateLoyaltyAccount` request when creating a loyalty account for a buyer who already interacted with their account.<br>For example, you would set this field when migrating accounts from an external system. The timestamp in the request can represent a current or previous date and time, but it cannot be set for the future. |
| `created_at` | `str` | Optional | The timestamp when the loyalty account was created, in RFC 3339 format. |
| `updated_at` | `str` | Optional | The timestamp when the loyalty account was last updated, in RFC 3339 format. |
| `mapping` | [`Loyalty Account Mapping`](../../doc/models/loyalty-account-mapping.md) | Optional | Represents the mapping that associates a loyalty account with a buyer.<br><br>Currently, a loyalty account can only be mapped to a buyer by phone number. For more information, see<br>[Loyalty Overview](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/loyalty/overview). |
| `expiring_point_deadlines` | [`List Loyalty Account Expiring Point Deadline`](../../doc/models/loyalty-account-expiring-point-deadline.md) | Optional | The schedule for when points expire in the loyalty account balance. This field is present only if the account has points that are scheduled to expire.<br><br>The total number of points in this field equals the number of points in the `balance` field. |
