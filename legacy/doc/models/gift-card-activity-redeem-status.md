# Gift Card Activity Redeem Status

Indicates the status of a [gift card](../../doc/models/gift-card.md) redemption. This status is relevant only for
redemptions made from Square products (such as Square Point of Sale) because Square products use a
two-state process. Gift cards redeemed using the Gift Card Activities API always have a `COMPLETED` status.
