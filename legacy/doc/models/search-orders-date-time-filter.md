# Search Orders Date Time Filter

Filter for `Order` objects based on whether their `CREATED_AT`,
`CLOSED_AT`, or `UPDATED_AT` timestamps fall within a specified time range.
You can specify the time range and which timestamp to filter for. You can filter
for only one time range at a time.

For each time range, the start time and end time are inclusive. If the end time
is absent, it defaults to the time of the first request for the cursor.

__Important:__ If you use the `DateTimeFilter` in a `SearchOrders` query,
you must set the `sort_field` in [OrdersSort](../../doc/models/search-orders-sort.md)
to the same field you filter for. For example, if you set the `CLOSED_AT` field
in `DateTimeFilter`, you must set the `sort_field` in `SearchOrdersSort` to
`CLOSED_AT`. Otherwise, `SearchOrders` throws an error.
