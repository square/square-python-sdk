# Fulfillment

Contains details about how to fulfill this order.
Orders can only be created with at most one fulfillment using the API.
However, orders returned by the Orders API might contain multiple fulfillments because sellers can create multiple fulfillments using Square products such as Square Online.

Do not use metadata to store any sensitive information (such as personally<br>identifiable information or card details).<br><br>Keys written by applications must be 60 characters or less and must be in the character set<br>`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`. Entries can also include metadata generated by Square. These keys are prefixed<br>with a namespace, separated from the key with a ':' character.<br><br>Values have a maximum length of 255 characters.<br><br>An application can have up to 10 entries per metadata field.<br><br>Entries written by applications are private and can only be read or modified by the same<br>application.<br><br>For more information, see [Metadata](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/metadata). |
