| `metadata` | `Dict[str, str]` | Optional | Application-defined data attached to this fulfillment entry. Metadata fields are intended<br>to store descriptive references or associations with an entity in another system or store brief<br>information about the object.

Do not use metadata to store any sensitive information (such as personally<br>identifiable information or card details).<br>Keys written by applications must be 60 characters or less and must be in the character set<br>`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`. Entries can also include metadata generated by Square. These keys are prefixed<br>with a namespace, separated from the key with a ':' character.<br>Values have a maximum length of 255 characters.<br>An application can have up to 10 entries per metadata field.<br>Entries written by applications are private and can only be read or modified by the same<br>application.<br>For more information, see [Metadata](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/metadata). |
