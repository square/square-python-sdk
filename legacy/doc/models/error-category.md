## Fields

| Name | Description |
|  --- | --- |

You might receive this error if your application sends a high number of requests<br>to Square APIs in a short period of time.<br><br>Your application should monitor responses for `429 RATE_LIMITED` errors and use a retry mechanism with an [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff)<br>schedule to resend the requests at an increasingly slower rate. It is also a good practice to use a randomized delay (jitter) in your retry schedule. |
