        Activates a domain for use with Apple Pay on the Web and Square. A
        validation

        is performed on this domain by Apple to ensure that it is properly set
        up as

        an Apple Pay enabled domain.


        This endpoint provides an easy way for platform developers to bulk
        activate

        Apple Pay on the Web with Square for merchants using their platform.


        Note: You will need to host a valid domain verification file on your
        domain to support Apple Pay.  The

        current version of this file is always available at
        https://app.squareup.com/digital-wallets/apple-pay/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association,

        and should be hosted at
        `.well_known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` on your

        domain.  This file is subject to change; we strongly recommend checking
        for updates regularly and avoiding

        long-lived caches that might not keep in sync with the correct file
        version.
