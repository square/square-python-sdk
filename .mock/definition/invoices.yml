        Publishes the specified draft invoice. 


        After an invoice is published, Square 

        follows up based on the invoice configuration. For example, Square 

        sends the invoice to the customer's email address, charges the
        customer's card on file, or does 

        nothing. Square also makes the invoice available on a Square-hosted
        invoice page. 


        The invoice `status` also changes from `DRAFT` to a status 

        based on the invoice configuration. For example, the status changes to
        `UNPAID` if 

        Square emails the invoice or `PARTIALLY_PAID` if Square charges a card
        on file for a portion of the 

        invoice amount.


        In addition to the required `ORDERS_WRITE` and `INVOICES_WRITE`
        permissions, `CUSTOMERS_READ`

        and `PAYMENTS_WRITE` are required when publishing invoices configured
        for card-on-file payments.

                The version of the [invoice](entity:Invoice) to publish.

                This must match the current version of the invoice; otherwise,
                the request is rejected.

                A unique string that identifies the `PublishInvoice` request. If
                you do not 

                provide `idempotency_key` (or provide an empty string as the
                value), the endpoint 

                treats each request as independent.
