        After an invoice is published, Square

        customer's card on file, or does 

        nothing. Square also makes the invoice available on a Square-hosted
        invoice page. 


        The invoice `status` also changes from `DRAFT` to a status 

        based on the invoice configuration. For example, the status changes to
        `UNPAID` if 

        Square emails the invoice or `PARTIALLY_PAID` if Square charges a card
        on file for a portion of the 

        invoice amount.


        In addition to the required `ORDERS_WRITE` and `INVOICES_WRITE`
        permissions, `CUSTOMERS_READ`

        and `PAYMENTS_WRITE` are required when publishing invoices configured
        for card-on-file payments.
