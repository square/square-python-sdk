        Creates a [location](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api).

        Creating new locations allows for separate configuration of receipt
        layouts, item prices,

        and sales reports. Developers can use locations to separate sales
        activity through applications

        that integrate with Square from sales activity elsewhere in a seller's
        account.

        Locations created programmatically with the Locations API last forever
        and

        are visible to the seller for their own management. Therefore, ensure
        that

        each location has a sensible and unique name.

                A unique string that identifies this checkout among others you
                have created. It can be

                any valid string but must be unique for every order sent to
                Square Checkout for a given location ID.


                The idempotency key is used to avoid processing the same order
                more than once. If you are 

                unsure whether a particular checkout was created successfully,
                you can attempt it again with

                the same idempotency key and all the same other parameters
                without worrying about creating duplicates.


                You should use a random number/string generator native to the
                language

                you are working in to generate strings for your idempotency
                keys.

                display the

                primary email address associated with the seller's Square

                `checkoutId`,

                `transactionId`, and `referenceId` appended as URL parameters.
                For example,

                if the provided redirect URL is
                `http://www.example.com/order-complete`, a

                successful transaction redirects the customer to:


                `http://www.example.com/order-complete?checkoutId=xxxxxx&amp;referenceId=xxxxxx&amp;transactionId=xxxxxx`


                If you do not provide a redirect URL, Square Checkout displays
                an order

                confirmation page on your behalf; however, it is strongly
                recommended that

                you provide a redirect URL so you can verify the transaction
                results and

                finalize the order through your existing/normal confirmation
                workflow.

                If you provide this value, the `amount_money` value in your
                `additional_recipients` field

                cannot be more than 90% of the `total_money` calculated by
                Square for your order.

                The `location_id` must be a valid seller location where the
                checkout is occurring.
