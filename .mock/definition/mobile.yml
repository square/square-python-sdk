        __Note:__ This endpoint is used by the deprecated Reader SDK. 

        Developers should update their integration to use the [Mobile Payments
        SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/mobile-payments-sdk), which
        includes its own authorization methods. 


        Generates code to authorize a mobile application to connect to a Square
        card reader.


        Authorization codes are one-time-use codes and expire 60 minutes after
        being issued.


        The `Authorization` header you provide to this endpoint must have the
        following format:


        ```

        Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN

        ```


        Replace `ACCESS_TOKEN` with a

        [valid production authorization
        credential](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/access-tokens).
