        Adds a card on file to an existing customer.

        As with charges, calls to `CreateCustomerCard` are idempotent. Multiple
        calls with the same card nonce return the same card record that was created
        with the provided nonce during the _first_ call.

        Parameters
        ----------
        customer_id : str
            The Square ID of the customer profile the card is linked to.

        card_nonce : str
            A card nonce representing the credit card to link to the customer.

            Card nonces are generated by the Square payment form when customers enter
            their card information. For more information, see
            [Walkthrough: Integrate Square Payments in a Website](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/take-card-payment).

            __NOTE:__ Card nonces generated by digital wallets (such as Apple Pay)
            cannot be used to create a customer card.

        billing_address : typing.Optional[AddressParams]
            Address information for the card on file.

            __NOTE:__ If a billing address is provided in the request, the
            `CreateCustomerCardRequest.billing_address.postal_code` must match
            the postal code encoded in the card nonce.

        cardholder_name : typing.Optional[str]
            The full name printed on the credit card.

        verification_token : typing.Optional[str]
            An identifying token generated by [Payments.verifyBuyer()](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments/objects/Payments#Payments.verifyBuyer).
            Verification tokens encapsulate customer device information and 3-D Secure
            challenge results to indicate that Square has verified the buyer identity.

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
