        Generates code to authorize a mobile application to connect to a Square card reader.

        Authorization codes are one-time-use codes and expire 60 minutes after being issued.

        The `Authorization` header you provide to this endpoint must have the following format:

        ```
        Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN

        Replace `ACCESS_TOKEN` with a
        [valid production authorization credential](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/access-tokens).

        Parameters
        ----------
        location_id : typing.Optional[str]
            The Square location ID that the authorization code should be tied to.

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
            Request-specific configuration.

        Returns
        -------
        CreateMobileAuthorizationCodeResponse
