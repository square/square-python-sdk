        version : int

        """
        Publishes the specified draft invoice.

        After an invoice is published, Square
        follows up based on the invoice configuration. For example, Square
        sends the invoice to the customer's email address, charges the customer's card on file, or does
        nothing. Square also makes the invoice available on a Square-hosted invoice page.

        The invoice `status` also changes from `DRAFT` to a status
        based on the invoice configuration. For example, the status changes to `UNPAID` if
        Square emails the invoice or `PARTIALLY_PAID` if Square charges a card on file for a portion of the
        invoice amount.

        In addition to the required `ORDERS_WRITE` and `INVOICES_WRITE` permissions, `CUSTOMERS_READ`
        and `PAYMENTS_WRITE` are required when publishing invoices configured for card-on-file payments.

        Parameters
        ----------
        invoice_id : str
            The ID of the invoice to publish.

        version : int
            The version of the [invoice](entity:Invoice) to publish.
            This must match the current version of the invoice; otherwise, the request is rejected.

        idempotency_key : typing.Optional[str]
            A unique string that identifies the `PublishInvoice` request. If you do not
            provide `idempotency_key` (or provide an empty string as the value), the endpoint
            treats each request as independent.

        """
        Publishes the specified draft invoice.

        After an invoice is published, Square
        follows up based on the invoice configuration. For example, Square
        sends the invoice to the customer's email address, charges the customer's card on file, or does
        nothing. Square also makes the invoice available on a Square-hosted invoice page.

        The invoice `status` also changes from `DRAFT` to a status
        based on the invoice configuration. For example, the status changes to `UNPAID` if
        Square emails the invoice or `PARTIALLY_PAID` if Square charges a card on file for a portion of the
        invoice amount.

        In addition to the required `ORDERS_WRITE` and `INVOICES_WRITE` permissions, `CUSTOMERS_READ`
        and `PAYMENTS_WRITE` are required when publishing invoices configured for card-on-file payments.

        Parameters
        ----------
        invoice_id : str
            The ID of the invoice to publish.

        version : int
            The version of the [invoice](entity:Invoice) to publish.
            This must match the current version of the invoice; otherwise, the request is rejected.

        idempotency_key : typing.Optional[str]
            A unique string that identifies the `PublishInvoice` request. If you do not
            provide `idempotency_key` (or provide an empty string as the value), the endpoint
            treats each request as independent.
