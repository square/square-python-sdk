    Your application should be able to handle loyalty accounts that have a negative point balance (`balance` is less than 0). This might occur if a seller makes a manual adjustment or as a result of a refund or exchange.

    The timestamp when the buyer joined the loyalty program, in RFC 3339 format. This field is used to display the **Enrolled On** or **Member Since** date in first-party Square products.
    
    If this field is not set in a `CreateLoyaltyAccount` request, Square populates it after the buyer's first action on their account 
    (when `AccumulateLoyaltyPoints` or `CreateLoyaltyReward` is called). In first-party flows, Square populates the field when the buyer agrees to the terms of service in Square Point of Sale. 
    
    This field is typically specified in a `CreateLoyaltyAccount` request when creating a loyalty account for a buyer who already interacted with their account. 
    For example, you would set this field when migrating accounts from an external system. The timestamp in the request can represent a current or previous date and time, but it cannot be set for the future.

    The mapping that associates the loyalty account with a buyer. Currently,
    a loyalty account can only be mapped to a buyer by phone number.
