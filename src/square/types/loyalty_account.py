    The available point balance in the loyalty account. If points are scheduled to expire, they are listed in the `expiring_point_deadlines` field.
    
    Your application should be able to handle loyalty accounts that have a negative point balance (`balance` is less than 0). This might occur if a seller makes a manual adjustment or as a result of a refund or exchange.

    The timestamp when the buyer joined the loyalty program, in RFC 3339 format. This field is used to display the **Enrolled On** or **Member Since** date in first-party Square products.
    
    If this field is not set in a `CreateLoyaltyAccount` request, Square populates it after the buyer's first action on their account 
    (when `AccumulateLoyaltyPoints` or `CreateLoyaltyReward` is called). In first-party flows, Square populates the field when the buyer agrees to the terms of service on Square Point of Sale. 
    
    If this field is set in a `CreateLoyaltyAccount` request, it is meant to be used when there is a loyalty migration from another system and into Square.
    In that case, the timestamp can reflect when the buyer originally enrolled in the previous system. It may represent a current or past date, but cannot be set in the future.
    Note: Setting this field in this scenario does not, by itself, impact the first-party enrollment flow on Square Point of Sale.

    The mapping that associates the loyalty account with a buyer. Currently,
    a loyalty account can only be mapped to a buyer by phone number.
