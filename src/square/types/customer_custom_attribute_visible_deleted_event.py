    Published when a customer [custom attribute](entity:CustomAttribute) that is visible to the
    subscribing application is deleted. A notification is sent when:
    - Your application deletes a custom attribute owned by your application, regardless of the `visibility` setting.
    - Any application deletes a custom attribute whose `visibility` is `VISIBILITY_READ_ONLY`
    or `VISIBILITY_READ_WRITE_VALUES`.

    Custom attributes set to `VISIBILITY_READ_WRITE_VALUES` can be deleted by any application, but those set to
    `VISIBILITY_READ_ONLY` or `VISIBILITY_HIDDEN` can only be deleted by the owner. Custom attributes are owned
    by the application that created the corresponding [custom attribute definition](entity:CustomAttributeDefinition).
