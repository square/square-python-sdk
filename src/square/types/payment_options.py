    The duration of time after the payment's creation when Square automatically resolves the
    payment. This automatic resolution applies only to payments that do not reach a terminal state
    (`COMPLETED` or `CANCELED`) before the `delay_duration` time period.
    
    This parameter should be specified as a time duration, in RFC 3339 format, with a minimum value
    of 1 minute and a maximum value of 36 hours. This feature is only supported for card payments,
    and all payments will be considered card-present.
    
    This parameter can only be set for a delayed capture payment (`autocomplete=false`). For more
    information, see [Delayed Capture](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments/card-payments/delayed-capture#time-threshold).

    If set to `true` and charging a Square Gift Card, a payment might be returned with
    `amount_money` equal to less than what was requested. For example, a request for $20 when charging
    a Square Gift Card with a balance of $5 results in an APPROVED payment of $5. You might choose
    to prompt the buyer for an additional payment to cover the remainder or cancel the Gift Card
    payment.
    
    This parameter can only be set for a delayed capture payment (`autocomplete=false`).
