class CustomerCustomAttributeFilterValue(UncheckedBaseModel):
    """
    A type-specific filter used in a [custom attribute filter](entity:CustomerCustomAttributeFilter) to search based on the value
    of a customer-related [custom attribute](entity:CustomAttribute).
    """

    email: typing.Optional[CustomerTextFilter] = pydantic.Field(default=None)
    """
    A filter for a query based on the value of an `Email`-type custom attribute. This filter is case-insensitive and can
    include `exact` or `fuzzy`, but not both.
    
    For an `exact` match, provide the complete email address.
    
    For a `fuzzy` match, provide a query expression containing one or more query tokens to match against the email address. Square removes
    any punctuation (including periods (.), underscores (_), and the @ symbol) and tokenizes the email addresses on spaces. A match is found
    if a tokenized email address contains all the tokens in the search query, irrespective of the token order. For example, `Steven gmail`
    matches steven.jones@gmail.com and mygmail@stevensbakery.com.
    """

    phone: typing.Optional[CustomerTextFilter] = pydantic.Field(default=None)
    """
    A filter for a query based on the value of a `PhoneNumber`-type custom attribute. This filter is case-insensitive and
    can include `exact` or `fuzzy`, but not both.
    
    For an `exact` match, provide the complete phone number. This is always an E.164-compliant phone number that starts
    with the + sign followed by the country code and subscriber number. For example, the format for a US phone number is +12061112222.
    
    For a `fuzzy` match, provide a query expression containing one or more query tokens to match against the phone number.
    Square removes any punctuation and tokenizes the expression on spaces. A match is found if a tokenized phone number contains
    all the tokens in the search query, irrespective of the token order. For example, `415 123 45` is tokenized to `415`, `123`, and `45`,
    which matches +14151234567 and +12345674158, but does not match +1234156780. Similarly, the expression `415` matches
    +14151234567, +12345674158, and +1234156780.
    """

    text: typing.Optional[CustomerTextFilter] = pydantic.Field(default=None)
    """
    A filter for a query based on the value of a `String`-type custom attribute. This filter is case-insensitive and 
    can include `exact` or `fuzzy`, but not both.
    
    For an `exact` match, provide the complete string.
    
    For a `fuzzy` match, provide a query expression containing one or more query tokens in any order that contain complete words
    to match against the string. Square tokenizes the expression using a grammar-based tokenizer. For example, the expressions `quick brown`,
    `brown quick`, and `quick fox` match "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". However, `quick foxes` and `qui` do not match.
    """

    selection: typing.Optional[FilterValue] = pydantic.Field(default=None)
    """
    A filter for a query based on the display name for a `Selection`-type custom attribute value. This filter is case-sensitive
    and can contain `any`, `all`, or both. The `none` condition is not supported.
    
    Provide the display name of each item that you want to search for. To find the display names for the selection, use the 
    [Customer Custom Attributes API](api:CustomerCustomAttributes) to retrieve the corresponding custom attribute definition
    and then check the `schema.items.names` field. For more information, see
    [Search based on selection](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/use-the-api/search-customers#custom-attribute-value-filter-selection).
    
    Note that when a `Selection`-type custom attribute is assigned to a customer profile, the custom attribute value is a list of one
    or more UUIDs (sourced from the `schema.items.enum` field) that map to the item names. These UUIDs are unique per seller.
    """

    date: typing.Optional[TimeRange] = pydantic.Field(default=None)
    """
    A filter for a query based on the value of a `Date`-type custom attribute.
    
    Provide a date range for this filter using `start_at`, `end_at`, or both. Range boundaries are inclusive. Dates can be specified
    in `YYYY-MM-DD` format or as RFC 3339 timestamps.
    """

    number: typing.Optional[FloatNumberRange] = pydantic.Field(default=None)
    """
    A filter for a query based on the value of a `Number`-type custom attribute, which can be an integer or a decimal with up to
    5 digits of precision.
    
    Provide a numerical range for this filter using `start_at`, `end_at`, or both. Range boundaries are inclusive. Numbers are specified
    as decimals or integers. The absolute value of range boundaries must not exceed `(2^63-1)/10^5`, or 92233720368547.
