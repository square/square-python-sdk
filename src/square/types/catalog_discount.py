    The percentage of the discount as a string representation of a decimal number, using a `.` as the decimal

    Indicates whether this discount should reduce the price used to calculate tax.
    
    Most discounts should use `MODIFY_TAX_BASIS`. However, in some circumstances taxes must
    be calculated based on an item's price, ignoring a particular discount. For example,
    in many US jurisdictions, a manufacturer coupon or instant rebate reduces the price a
    customer pays but does not reduce the sale price used to calculate how much sales tax is
    due. In this case, the discount representing that manufacturer coupon should have
    `DO_NOT_MODIFY_TAX_BASIS` for this field.
    
    If you are unsure whether you need to use this field, consult your tax professional.

    For a percentage discount, the maximum absolute value of the discount. For example, if a
    50% discount has a `maximum_amount_money` of $20, a $100 purchase will yield a $20 discount,
