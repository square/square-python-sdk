    For example, suppose a restaurant offers a cheeseburger on the menu. When a buyer orders
    this item, the restaurant records the purchase by creating an `Order` object with a line item
    for a burger. The line item includes a line item modifier: the name is cheese and the quantity
    is 1. The buyer has the option to order extra cheese (or no cheese). If the buyer chooses
    the extra cheese option, the modifier quantity increases to 2. If the buyer does not want

    Application-defined data attached to this order. Metadata fields are intended
    to store descriptive references or associations with an entity in another system or store brief
    information about the object. Square does not process this field; it only stores and returns it
    in relevant API calls. Do not use metadata to store any sensitive information (such as personally
    identifiable information or card details).
    
    Keys written by applications must be 60 characters or less and must be in the character set
    `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`. Entries can also include metadata generated by Square. These keys are prefixed
    with a namespace, separated from the key with a ':' character.
    
    Values have a maximum length of 255 characters.
    
    An application can have up to 10 entries per metadata field.
    
    Entries written by applications are private and can only be read or modified by the same
    application.
