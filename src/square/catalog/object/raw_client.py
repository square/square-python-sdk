        object : CatalogObjectParams

        Parameters
        ----------
        object_id : str

        include_related_objects : typing.Optional[bool]
            If `true`, the response will include additional objects that are related to the

            helpful when the objects are needed for immediate display to a user.
            This process only goes one level deep. Objects referenced by the related objects will not be included. For example,

            if the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItem, its associated

            its parent CatalogItem will be returned in the `related_objects` field of

            Default value: `false`

        catalog_version : typing.Optional[int]
            Requests objects as of a specific version of the catalog. This allows you to retrieve historical
            versions of objects. The value to retrieve a specific version of an object can be found
            in the version field of [CatalogObject](entity:CatalogObject)s. If not included, results will
            be from the current version of the catalog.

        include_category_path_to_root : typing.Optional[bool]
            Specifies whether or not to include the `path_to_root` list for each returned category instance. The `path_to_root` list consists
            of `CategoryPathToRootNode` objects and specifies the path that starts with the immediate parent category of the returned category
            and ends with its root category. If the returned category is a top-level category, the `path_to_root` list is empty and is not returned
