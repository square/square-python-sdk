        idempotency_key : str
            A value you specify that uniquely identifies this

            a valid idempotency key is to use a Universally unique

            If you're unsure whether a particular request was successful,
            you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without
            worrying about creating duplicate objects.

            See [Idempotency](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/common-api-patterns/idempotency) for more information.

        object : CatalogObjectParams
            A CatalogObject to be created or updated.

            - For updates, the object must be active (the `is_deleted` field is not `true`).
            - For creates, the object ID must start with `#`. The provided ID is replaced with a server-generated ID.

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]

        object includes all of the relevant [CatalogItem](entity:CatalogItem)

        [CatalogModifierList](entity:CatalogModifierList) objects, and the ids of
        any [CatalogTax](entity:CatalogTax) objects that apply to it.

        Parameters
        ----------
        object_id : str
            The object ID of any type of catalog objects to be retrieved.

        include_related_objects : typing.Optional[bool]
            If `true`, the response will include additional objects that are related to the
            requested objects. Related objects are defined as any objects referenced by ID by the results in the `objects` field
            of the response. These objects are put in the `related_objects` field. Setting this to `true` is
            helpful when the objects are needed for immediate display to a user.
            This process only goes one level deep. Objects referenced by the related objects will not be included. For example,

            if the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItem, its associated
            CatalogCategory objects, CatalogTax objects, CatalogImage objects and
            CatalogModifierLists will be returned in the `related_objects` field of the
            response. If the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItemVariation,
            its parent CatalogItem will be returned in the `related_objects` field of
            the response.

            Default value: `false`

        catalog_version : typing.Optional[int]
            Requests objects as of a specific version of the catalog. This allows you to retrieve historical
            versions of objects. The value to retrieve a specific version of an object can be found
            in the version field of [CatalogObject](entity:CatalogObject)s. If not included, results will
            be from the current version of the catalog.

        include_category_path_to_root : typing.Optional[bool]
            Specifies whether or not to include the `path_to_root` list for each returned category instance. The `path_to_root` list consists
            of `CategoryPathToRootNode` objects and specifies the path that starts with the immediate parent category of the returned category
            and ends with its root category. If the returned category is a top-level category, the `path_to_root` list is empty and is not returned
            in the response payload.

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
            Request-specific configuration.

        Deletion is a cascading event such that all children of the targeted object
