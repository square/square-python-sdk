class CatalogItemVariationParams(typing_extensions.TypedDict):
    """
    An item variation, representing a product for sale, in the Catalog object model. Each [item](entity:CatalogItem) must have at least one
    item variation and can have at most 250 item variations.

    An item variation can be sellable, stockable, or both if it has a unit of measure for its count for the sold number of the variation, the stocked
    number of the variation, or both. For example, when a variation representing wine is stocked and sold by the bottle, the variation is both
    stockable and sellable. But when a variation of the wine is sold by the glass, the sold units cannot be used as a measure of the stocked units. This by-the-glass
    variation is sellable, but not stockable. To accurately keep track of the wine's inventory count at any time, the sellable count must be
    converted to stockable count. Typically, the seller defines this unit conversion. For example, 1 bottle equals 5 glasses. The Square API exposes
    the `stockable_conversion` property on the variation to specify the conversion. Thus, when two glasses of the wine are sold, the sellable count
    decreases by 2, and the stockable count automatically decreases by 0.4 bottle according to the conversion.

    The item variation's name. This is a searchable attribute for use in applicable query filters.
    
    Its value has a maximum length of 255 Unicode code points. However, when the parent [item](entity:CatalogItem)
    uses [item options](entity:CatalogItemOption), this attribute is auto-generated, read-only, and can be
    longer than 255 Unicode code points.

    The universal product code (UPC) of the item variation, if any. This is a searchable attribute for use in applicable query filters.
    
    The value of this attribute should be a number of 12-14 digits long.  This restriction is enforced on the Square Seller Dashboard,
    Square Point of Sale or Retail Point of Sale apps, where this attribute shows in the GTIN field. If a non-compliant UPC value is assigned
    to this attribute using the API, the value is not editable on the Seller Dashboard, Square Point of Sale or Retail Point of Sale apps
    unless it is updated to fit the expected format.

    ordinal: typing_extensions.NotRequired[int]
    """
    The order in which this item variation should be displayed. This value is read-only. On writes, the ordinal
    for each item variation within a parent `CatalogItem` is set according to the item variations's
    position. On reads, the value is not guaranteed to be sequential or unique.

    pricing_type: typing_extensions.NotRequired[CatalogPricingType]

    If the `CatalogItem` that owns this item variation is of type

    Whether this variation can be sold. The inventory count of a sellable variation indicates

    Whether stock is counted directly on this variation (TRUE) or only on its components (FALSE).
    When a variation is both stockable and sellable, the inventory count of a stockable variation keeps track of the number of units of this variation in stock
