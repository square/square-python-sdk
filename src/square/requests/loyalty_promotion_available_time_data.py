    Represents scheduling information that determines when purchases can qualify to earn points
    from a [loyalty promotion](entity:LoyaltyPromotion).

    The date that the promotion starts, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Square populates this field
    based on the provided `time_periods`.
    """

    end_date: typing_extensions.NotRequired[str]
    """
    The date that the promotion ends, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Square populates this field
    based on the provided `time_periods`. If an end date is not specified, an `ACTIVE` promotion
    remains available until it is canceled.

    time_periods: typing.Sequence[str]
    """
    A list of [iCalendar (RFC 5545) events](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.6.1)
    (`VEVENT`). Each event represents an available time period per day or days of the week. 
    A day can have a maximum of one available time period.
    
    Only `DTSTART`, `DURATION`, and `RRULE` are supported. `DTSTART` and `DURATION` are required and
    timestamps must be in local (unzoned) time format. Include `RRULE` to specify recurring promotions,
    an end date (using the `UNTIL` keyword), or both. For more information, see
    [Available time](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/loyalty-api/loyalty-promotions#available-time).
    
    Note that `BEGIN:VEVENT` and `END:VEVENT` are optional in a `CreateLoyaltyPromotion` request
    but are always included in the response.
