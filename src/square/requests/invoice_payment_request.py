class InvoicePaymentRequestParams(typing_extensions.TypedDict):
    """
    Represents a payment request for an [invoice](entity:Invoice). Invoices can specify a maximum
    of 13 payment requests, with up to 12 `INSTALLMENT` request types. For more information,
    see [Configuring payment requests](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/invoices-api/create-publish-invoices#payment-requests).

    Adding `INSTALLMENT` payment requests to an invoice requires an
    [Invoices Plus subscription](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/invoices-api/overview#invoices-plus-subscription).
    """

    uid: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    The Square-generated ID of the payment request in an [invoice](entity:Invoice).
    """

    request_method: typing_extensions.NotRequired[InvoiceRequestMethod]
    """
    Indicates how Square processes the payment request. DEPRECATED at version 2021-01-21. Replaced by the
    `Invoice.delivery_method` and `InvoicePaymentRequest.automatic_payment_source` fields.
    
    One of the following is required when creating an invoice:
    - (Recommended) The `delivery_method` field of the invoice. To configure an automatic payment, the
    `automatic_payment_source` field of the payment request is also required.
    - This `request_method` field. Note that `invoice` objects returned in responses do not include `request_method`.
    See [InvoiceRequestMethod](#type-invoicerequestmethod) for possible values
    """

    request_type: typing_extensions.NotRequired[InvoiceRequestType]
    """
    Identifies the payment request type. This type defines how the payment request amount is determined. 
    This field is required to create a payment request.
    See [InvoiceRequestType](#type-invoicerequesttype) for possible values
    """

    due_date: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    The due date (in the invoice's time zone) for the payment request, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. This field
    is required to create a payment request. If an `automatic_payment_source` is defined for the request, Square
    charges the payment source on this date.
    
    After this date, the invoice becomes overdue. For example, a payment `due_date` of 2021-03-09 with a `timezone`
    of America/Los\_Angeles becomes overdue at midnight on March 9 in America/Los\_Angeles (which equals a UTC
    timestamp of 2021-03-10T08:00:00Z).
    """

    fixed_amount_requested_money: typing_extensions.NotRequired[MoneyParams]
    """
    If the payment request specifies `DEPOSIT` or `INSTALLMENT` as the `request_type`, 
    this indicates the request amount.
    You cannot specify this when `request_type` is `BALANCE` or when the 
    payment request includes the `percentage_requested` field.
    """

    percentage_requested: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    Specifies the amount for the payment request in percentage:
    
    - When the payment `request_type` is `DEPOSIT`, it is the percentage of the order's total amount.
    - When the payment `request_type` is `INSTALLMENT`, it is the percentage of the order's total less 
    the deposit, if requested. The sum of the `percentage_requested` in all installment 
    payment requests must be equal to 100.
    
    You cannot specify this when the payment `request_type` is `BALANCE` or when the 
    payment request specifies the `fixed_amount_requested_money` field.
    """

    tipping_enabled: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[bool]]
    """
    If set to true, the Square-hosted invoice page (the `public_url` field of the invoice) 
    provides a place for the customer to pay a tip. 
    
    This field is allowed only on the final payment request  
    and the payment `request_type` must be `BALANCE` or `INSTALLMENT`.
    """

    automatic_payment_source: typing_extensions.NotRequired[InvoiceAutomaticPaymentSource]
    """
    The payment method for an automatic payment.
    
    The default value is `NONE`.
    See [InvoiceAutomaticPaymentSource](#type-invoiceautomaticpaymentsource) for possible values
    """

    card_id: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    The ID of the credit or debit card on file to charge for the payment request. To get the cards on file for a customer,
    call [ListCards](api-endpoint:Cards-ListCards) and include the `customer_id` of the invoice recipient.

    The amount of the payment request, computed using the order amount and information from the various payment
    request fields (`request_type`, `fixed_amount_requested_money`, and `percentage_requested`).
    """

    total_completed_amount_money: typing_extensions.NotRequired[MoneyParams]
    """
    The amount of money already paid for the specific payment request. 
    This amount might include a rounding adjustment if the most recent invoice payment 
    was in cash in a currency that rounds cash payments (such as, `CAD` or `AUD`).
    """

    rounding_adjustment_included_money: typing_extensions.NotRequired[MoneyParams]

    If the most recent payment was a cash payment 
    in a currency that rounds cash payments (such as, `CAD` or `AUD`) and the payment 
    is rounded from `computed_amount_money` in the payment request, then this 
    field specifies the rounding adjustment applied. This amount 
    might be negative.
