    """
    A tender represents a discrete monetary exchange. Square represents this
    exchange as a money object with a specific currency and amount, where the
    amount is given in the smallest denomination of the given currency.

    Square POS can accept more than one form of tender for a single payment (such
    as by splitting a bill between a credit card and a gift card). The `tender`
    field of the Payment object lists all forms of tender used for the payment.

    Split tender payments behave slightly differently from single tender payments:

    The receipt_url for a split tender corresponds only to the first tender listed
    in the tender field. To get the receipt URLs for the remaining tenders, use
    the receipt_url fields of the corresponding Tender objects.

    *A note on gift cards**: when a customer purchases a Square gift card from a
    merchant, the merchant receives the full amount of the gift card in the
    associated payment.

    When that gift card is used as a tender, the balance of the gift card is
    reduced and the merchant receives no funds. A `Tender` object with a type of
    `SQUARE_GIFT_CARD` indicates a gift card was used for some or all of the
    associated payment.
