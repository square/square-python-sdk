    This option is allowed only for invoices that have a single payment request of the `BALANCE` type. This payment method is
    supported if the seller account accepts Afterpay payments and the seller location is in a country where Afterpay
    invoice payments are supported. As a best practice, consider enabling an additional payment method when allowing
    `buy_now_pay_later` payments. For more information, including detailed requirements and processing limits, see
    [Buy Now Pay Later payments with Afterpay](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/invoices-api/overview#buy-now-pay-later).
