    """
    Filter for `Order` objects based on whether their `CREATED_AT`,
    `CLOSED_AT`, or `UPDATED_AT` timestamps fall within a specified time range.
    You can specify the time range and which timestamp to filter for. You can filter
    for only one time range at a time.

    For each time range, the start time and end time are inclusive. If the end time
    is absent, it defaults to the time of the first request for the cursor.

    __Important:__ If you use the `DateTimeFilter` in a `SearchOrders` query,
    you must set the `sort_field` in [OrdersSort](entity:SearchOrdersSort)
    to the same field you filter for. For example, if you set the `CLOSED_AT` field
    in `DateTimeFilter`, you must set the `sort_field` in `SearchOrdersSort` to
    `CLOSED_AT`. Otherwise, `SearchOrders` throws an error.
