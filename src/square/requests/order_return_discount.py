    Represents a discount being returned that applies to one or more return line items in an

    Fixed-amount, order-scoped discounts are distributed across all non-zero return line item totals.
    The amount distributed to each return line item is relative to that item’s contribution to the

    `OrderReturnLineItem`s with references in their `applied_discounts` field.
