    id: str
    """
    An identifier to reference this object in the catalog. When a new `CatalogObject`
    is inserted, the client should set the id to a temporary identifier starting with
    a "`#`" character. Other objects being inserted or updated within the same request
    may use this identifier to refer to the new object.
    
    When the server receives the new object, it will supply a unique identifier that
    replaces the temporary identifier for all future references.

    updated_at: typing_extensions.NotRequired[str]
    """
    Last modification [timestamp](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-dates) in RFC 3339 format, e.g., `"2016-08-15T23:59:33.123Z"`

    If `true`, the object has been deleted from the database. Must be `false` for new objects

    custom_attribute_values: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Dict[str, CatalogCustomAttributeValueParams]]
    """
    A map (key-value pairs) of application-defined custom attribute values. The value of a key-value pair
    is a [CatalogCustomAttributeValue](entity:CatalogCustomAttributeValue) object. The key is the `key` attribute
    value defined in the associated [CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition](entity:CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition)
    object defined by the application making the request.
    
    If the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition` object is
    defined by another application, the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition`'s key attribute value is prefixed by
    the defining application ID. For example, if the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition` has a `key` attribute of
    `"cocoa_brand"` and the defining application ID is `"abcd1234"`, the key in the map is `"abcd1234:cocoa_brand"`
    if the application making the request is different from the application defining the custom attribute definition.
    Otherwise, the key used in the map is simply `"cocoa_brand"`.
    
    Application-defined custom attributes are set at a global (location-independent) level.
    Custom attribute values are intended to store additional information about a catalog object
    or associations with an entity in another system. Do not use custom attributes
    to store any sensitive information (personally identifiable information, card details, etc.).
