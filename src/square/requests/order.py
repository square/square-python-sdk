    """
    Contains all information related to a single order to process with Square,
    including line items that specify the products to purchase. `Order` objects also
    include information about any associated tenders, refunds, and returns.

    All Connect V2 Transactions have all been converted to Orders including all associated
    itemization data.
    """

    id: typing_extensions.NotRequired[str]
    """
    The order's unique ID.
    """

    location_id: str
    """
    The ID of the seller location that this order is associated with.
    """

    reference_id: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    A client-specified ID to associate an entity in another system
    with this order.

    """
    The origination details of the order.
    """

    customer_id: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    The ID of the [customer](entity:Customer) associated with the order.
    
    You should specify a `customer_id` on the order (or the payment) to ensure that transactions
    are reliably linked to customers. Omitting this field might result in the creation of new
    [instant profiles](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/what-it-does#instant-profiles).
    """

    line_items: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[typing.Sequence[OrderLineItemParams]]]

    The line items included in the order.
    """

    taxes: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[typing.Sequence[OrderLineItemTaxParams]]]
    """
    The list of all taxes associated with the order.
    
    Taxes can be scoped to either `ORDER` or `LINE_ITEM`. For taxes with `LINE_ITEM` scope, an
    `OrderLineItemAppliedTax` must be added to each line item that the tax applies to. For taxes
    with `ORDER` scope, the server generates an `OrderLineItemAppliedTax` for every line item.
    
    On reads, each tax in the list includes the total amount of that tax applied to the order.
    
    __IMPORTANT__: If `LINE_ITEM` scope is set on any taxes in this field, using the deprecated
    `line_items.taxes` field results in an error. Use `line_items.applied_taxes`
    instead.
    """

    discounts: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[typing.Sequence[OrderLineItemDiscountParams]]]
    """
    The list of all discounts associated with the order.
    
    Discounts can be scoped to either `ORDER` or `LINE_ITEM`. For discounts scoped to `LINE_ITEM`,
    an `OrderLineItemAppliedDiscount` must be added to each line item that the discount applies to.
    For discounts with `ORDER` scope, the server generates an `OrderLineItemAppliedDiscount`
    for every line item.
    
    __IMPORTANT__: If `LINE_ITEM` scope is set on any discounts in this field, using the deprecated
    `line_items.discounts` field results in an error. Use `line_items.applied_discounts`
    instead.

    by the API might contain multiple fulfillments.
    """

    returns: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Sequence[OrderReturnParams]]
    """
    A collection of items from sale orders being returned in this one. Normally part of an
    itemized return or exchange. There is exactly one `Return` object per sale `Order` being
    referenced.

    """
    The rollup of the returned money amounts.
    """

    The net money amounts (sale money - return money).
    """

    rounding_adjustment: typing_extensions.NotRequired[OrderRoundingAdjustmentParams]
    """
    A positive rounding adjustment to the total of the order. This adjustment is commonly
    used to apply cash rounding when the minimum unit of account is smaller than the lowest physical
    denomination of the currency.

    """
    The tenders that were used to pay for the order.

    """
    The refunds that are part of this order.
    """

    metadata: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[typing.Dict[str, typing.Optional[str]]]]
    """
    Application-defined data attached to this order. Metadata fields are intended
    to store descriptive references or associations with an entity in another system or store brief
    information about the object. Square does not process this field; it only stores and returns it
    in relevant API calls. Do not use metadata to store any sensitive information (such as personally
    identifiable information or card details).
    
    Keys written by applications must be 60 characters or less and must be in the character set
    `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`. Entries can also include metadata generated by Square. These keys are prefixed
    with a namespace, separated from the key with a ':' character.
    
    Values have a maximum length of 255 characters.
    
    An application can have up to 10 entries per metadata field.
    
    Entries written by applications are private and can only be read or modified by the same
    application.
    
    For more information, see  [Metadata](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/metadata).

    state: typing_extensions.NotRequired[OrderState]
    """
    The current state of the order.
    See [OrderState](#type-orderstate) for possible values
    """

    version: typing_extensions.NotRequired[int]
    """
    The version number, which is incremented each time an update is committed to the order.
    Orders not created through the API do not include a version number and
    therefore cannot be updated.

    total_service_charge_money: typing_extensions.NotRequired[MoneyParams]
    """
    The total amount of money collected in service charges for the order.
    
    Note: `total_service_charge_money` is the sum of `applied_money` fields for each individual
    service charge. Therefore, `total_service_charge_money` only includes inclusive tax amounts,
    not additive tax amounts.
    """

    ticket_name: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    A short-term identifier for the order (such as a customer first name,
