    A unique ID that identifies the return service charge only within this order.
    """

    """
    The service charge `uid` from the order containing the original
    service charge. `source_service_charge_uid` is `null` for
    unlinked returns.

    The name of the service charge.

    percentage: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    The percentage of the service charge, as a string representation of
    a decimal number. For example, a value of `"7.25"` corresponds to a
    percentage of 7.25%.

    The amount of money applied to the order by the service charge, including
    any inclusive tax amounts, as calculated by Square.
    
    - For fixed-amount service charges, `applied_money` is equal to `amount_money`.
    - For percentage-based service charges, `applied_money` is the money calculated using the percentage.

    The total amount of money to collect for the service charge.
    
    __NOTE__: If an inclusive tax is applied to the service charge, `total_money`
    does not equal `applied_money` plus `total_tax_money` because the inclusive
    tax amount is already included in both `applied_money` and `total_tax_money`.

    The list of references to `OrderReturnTax` entities applied to the

    that references the `uid` of a top-level `OrderReturnTax` that is being
    applied to the `OrderReturnServiceCharge`. On reads, the applied amount is
    populated.

    scope: typing_extensions.NotRequired[OrderServiceChargeScope]
    """
    Indicates the level at which the apportioned service charge applies. For `ORDER`
    scoped service charges, Square generates references in `applied_service_charges` on
    all order line items that do not have them. For `LINE_ITEM` scoped service charges,
    the service charge only applies to line items with a service charge reference in their
    `applied_service_charges` field.
    
    This field is immutable. To change the scope of an apportioned service charge, you must delete
    the apportioned service charge and re-add it as a new apportioned service charge.
