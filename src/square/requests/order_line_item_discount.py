class OrderLineItemDiscountParams(typing_extensions.TypedDict):
    """
    Represents a discount that applies to one or more line items in an
    order.

    Fixed-amount, order-scoped discounts are distributed across all non-zero line item totals.
    The amount distributed to each line item is relative to the
    amount contributed by the item to the order subtotal.
    """

    uid: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    A unique ID that identifies the discount only within this order.
    """

    catalog_object_id: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    The catalog object ID referencing [CatalogDiscount](entity:CatalogDiscount).
    """

    catalog_version: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[int]]
    """
    The version of the catalog object that this discount references.
    """

    name: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    The discount's name.
    """

    type: typing_extensions.NotRequired[OrderLineItemDiscountType]
    """
    The type of the discount.
    
    Discounts that do not reference a catalog object ID must have a type of
    `FIXED_PERCENTAGE` or `FIXED_AMOUNT`.
    See [OrderLineItemDiscountType](#type-orderlineitemdiscounttype) for possible values
    """

    percentage: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    The percentage of the discount, as a string representation of a decimal number.
    A value of `7.25` corresponds to a percentage of 7.25%.
    
    `percentage` is not set for amount-based discounts.
    """

    amount_money: typing_extensions.NotRequired[MoneyParams]
    """
    The total declared monetary amount of the discount.
    
    `amount_money` is not set for percentage-based discounts.
    """

    applied_money: typing_extensions.NotRequired[MoneyParams]
    """
    The amount of discount actually applied to the line item.
    
    The amount represents the amount of money applied as a line-item scoped discount.
    When an amount-based discount is scoped to the entire order, the value
    of `applied_money` is different than `amount_money` because the total
    amount of the discount is distributed across all line items.
    """

    metadata: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[typing.Dict[str, typing.Optional[str]]]]
    """
    Application-defined data attached to this discount. Metadata fields are intended
    to store descriptive references or associations with an entity in another system or store brief
    information about the object. Square does not process this field; it only stores and returns it
    in relevant API calls. Do not use metadata to store any sensitive information (such as personally
    identifiable information or card details).
    
    Keys written by applications must be 60 characters or less and must be in the character set
    `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`. Entries can also include metadata generated by Square. These keys are prefixed
    with a namespace, separated from the key with a ':' character.
    
    Values have a maximum length of 255 characters.
    
    An application can have up to 10 entries per metadata field.
    
    Entries written by applications are private and can only be read or modified by the same
    application.
    
    For more information, see [Metadata](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/metadata).
    """

    scope: typing_extensions.NotRequired[OrderLineItemDiscountScope]
    """
    Indicates the level at which the discount applies. For `ORDER` scoped discounts,
    Square generates references in `applied_discounts` on all order line items that do
    not have them. For `LINE_ITEM` scoped discounts, the discount only applies to line items
    with a discount reference in their `applied_discounts` field.
    
    This field is immutable. To change the scope of a discount, you must delete
    the discount and re-add it as a new discount.
    See [OrderLineItemDiscountScope](#type-orderlineitemdiscountscope) for possible values
    """

    reward_ids: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Sequence[str]]
    """
    The reward IDs corresponding to this discount. The application and
    specification of discounts that have `reward_ids` are completely controlled by the backing
    criteria corresponding to the reward tiers of the rewards that are added to the order
    through the Loyalty API. To manually unapply discounts that are the result of added rewards,
    the rewards must be removed from the order through the Loyalty API.
    """

    pricing_rule_id: typing_extensions.NotRequired[str]
    """
    The object ID of a [pricing rule](entity:CatalogPricingRule) to be applied
    automatically to this discount. The specification and application of the discounts, to
    which a `pricing_rule_id` is assigned, are completely controlled by the corresponding
    pricing rule.
