class CatalogDiscountParams(typing_extensions.TypedDict):
    """
    A discount applicable to items.
    """

    name: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    The discount name. This is a searchable attribute for use in applicable query filters, and its value length is of Unicode code points.
    """

    discount_type: typing_extensions.NotRequired[CatalogDiscountType]
    """
    Indicates whether the discount is a fixed amount or percentage, or entered at the time of sale.
    See [CatalogDiscountType](#type-catalogdiscounttype) for possible values
    """

    percentage: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    The percentage of the discount as a string representation of a decimal number, using a `.` as the decimal
    separator and without a `%` sign. A value of `7.5` corresponds to `7.5%`. Specify a percentage of `0` if `discount_type`
    is `VARIABLE_PERCENTAGE`.
    
    Do not use this field for amount-based or variable discounts.
    """

    amount_money: typing_extensions.NotRequired[MoneyParams]
    """
    The amount of the discount. Specify an amount of `0` if `discount_type` is `VARIABLE_AMOUNT`.
    
    Do not use this field for percentage-based or variable discounts.
    """

    pin_required: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[bool]]
    """
    Indicates whether a mobile staff member needs to enter their PIN to apply the
    discount to a payment in the Square Point of Sale app.
    """

    label_color: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[str]]
    """
    The color of the discount display label in the Square Point of Sale app. This must be a valid hex color code.
    """

    modify_tax_basis: typing_extensions.NotRequired[CatalogDiscountModifyTaxBasis]
    """
    Indicates whether this discount should reduce the price used to calculate tax.
    
    Most discounts should use `MODIFY_TAX_BASIS`. However, in some circumstances taxes must
    be calculated based on an item's price, ignoring a particular discount. For example,
    in many US jurisdictions, a manufacturer coupon or instant rebate reduces the price a
    customer pays but does not reduce the sale price used to calculate how much sales tax is
    due. In this case, the discount representing that manufacturer coupon should have
    `DO_NOT_MODIFY_TAX_BASIS` for this field.
    
    If you are unsure whether you need to use this field, consult your tax professional.
    See [CatalogDiscountModifyTaxBasis](#type-catalogdiscountmodifytaxbasis) for possible values
    """

    maximum_amount_money: typing_extensions.NotRequired[MoneyParams]
    """
    For a percentage discount, the maximum absolute value of the discount. For example, if a
    50% discount has a `maximum_amount_money` of $20, a $100 purchase will yield a $20 discount,
    not a $50 discount.
