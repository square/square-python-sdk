    A map (key-value pairs) of application-defined custom attribute values. The value of a key-value pair
    is a [CatalogCustomAttributeValue](entity:CatalogCustomAttributeValue) object. The key is the `key` attribute
    value defined in the associated [CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition](entity:CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition)
    object defined by the application making the request.
    
    If the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition` object is
    defined by another application, the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition`'s key attribute value is prefixed by
    the defining application ID. For example, if the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition` has a `key` attribute of
    `"cocoa_brand"` and the defining application ID is `"abcd1234"`, the key in the map is `"abcd1234:cocoa_brand"`
    if the application making the request is different from the application defining the custom attribute definition.
    Otherwise, the key used in the map is simply `"cocoa_brand"`.
    
    Application-defined custom attributes are set at a global (location-independent) level.
    Custom attribute values are intended to store additional information about a catalog object
    or associations with an entity in another system. Do not use custom attributes
    to store any sensitive information (personally identifiable information, card details, etc.).
