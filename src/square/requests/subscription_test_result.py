class SubscriptionTestResultParams(typing_extensions.TypedDict):
    """
    Represents the result of testing a webhook subscription. Note: The actual API returns these fields at the root level of TestWebhookSubscriptionResponse, not nested under this object.
    """

    id: typing_extensions.NotRequired[str]
    """
    A Square-generated unique ID for the subscription test result.
    """

    status_code: typing_extensions.NotRequired[typing.Optional[int]]
    """

    """
    The timestamp of when the subscription was updated, in RFC 3339 format. For example, "2016-09-04T23:59:33.123Z".
    Because a subscription test result is unique, this field is the same as the `created_at` field.

    The URL that was used for the webhook notification test.
