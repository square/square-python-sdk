    """
    The overridden price at the specified location. If this is unspecified, the modifier price is not overridden.

    Indicates whether the modifier is sold out at the specified location or not. As an example, for cheese (modifier) burger (item), when the modifier is sold out, it is the cheese, but not the burger, that is sold out.
