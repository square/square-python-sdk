    An OAuth access token used to authorize Square API requests on behalf of the seller.
    Include this token as a bearer token in the `Authorization` header of your API requests.
    
    OAuth access tokens expire in 30 days (except `short_lived` access tokens). You should call
    `ObtainToken` and provide the returned `refresh_token` to get a new access token well before
    the current one expires. For more information, see [OAuth API: Walkthrough](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/oauth-api/walkthrough).
    """

    refresh_token: typing_extensions.NotRequired[str]
    """
    A refresh token that can be used in an `ObtainToken` request to generate a new access token.
    
    With the code flow:
    - For the `authorization_code` grant type, the refresh token is multi-use and never expires.
    - For the `refresh_token` grant type, the response returns the same refresh token.
    
    With the PKCE flow:
    - For the `authorization_code` grant type, the refresh token is single-use and expires in 90 days.
    - For the `refresh_token` grant type, the refresh token is a new single-use refresh token that expires in 90 days.
